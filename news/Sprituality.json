This shift blew apart the traditional religious systems that were in place at the time, and the psychedelics gave people a connection that they had never experienced before: a feeling that they were interconnected with the universe. When we see how much of our behavior is a defense mechanism to alleviate the pain of separateness, we begin to realize the importance of healthy intuitive and compassionate hearts.\",\"150\":\"On this special 100th episode of Here and Now, Ram Dass and Raghu Markus talk about imagination, faith, and gratitude. Ram Dass teaches us to see through our own delusions that mislead us and weigh us down with fear. Ram Dass brings insight to several important questions.

I guess it's difficult because the headspace app promotes being aware of thoughts\\/emotions and then returning back to the present moment, but recently it has been challenging to actually apply this practice in real life. The practice itself isn't as novel and \\\"new\\\" in my head, so it feels like i don't put as much mental emphasis on noticing thoughts\\/emotions. Don't get me wrong, I feel like I'm much more mentally capable of handling thoughts and emotions with meditation, but it's difficult to hold myself to the practice throughout the day because I'll go off in thought that isn't necessarily bad in the first place. Any tips or advice for how to handle this? Am I not committed to practicing meditation concepts throughout the day? Do I need to do something differently? Or am I simply overthinking the meditation process? Thanks for the help.

Kalyanaraman explains how the Technological development of a civilization adds up to the trade activity and contributes to the wealth of that nation. Quoting from Rigveda he says the mind of the artisan is yoked together in a technological framework and the thought process combines mind with materials resulting into Technology. He discusses in detail the seals and artifacts of 6th century BC that depict via pictographs the Tin bronze technology and copper evolution. The signs of metallurgy, drilling, weaving, bleaching, dyeing as well as inscribing are evident. There are objects that allude to gold coins, mint and jewellery in the 4th millenium BC during the times of seafaring Meluha Merchants. Dr. Kalyanaraman goes on to describe the 4th Millenium BC Hieroglyphs and the Indus script inscriptions with frequent field symbols like Bull, Agnikunda, gold ornaments etc. to indicate the advanced metallurgical technology. The ornaments and artifacts were highly in demand all over the Eurasia taken across oceans by maritime merchants. So the highly advance technology placed Sarasvati-Sindhu Civilization on the global trade map. About the Speaker: Dr. S. Kalyanaraman is a life-member of and regular participant in the World Association of Vedic Studies. He has authored many books on Sarasvati-Sindhu Civilization and vedic studies. He is National President of Rameshwaram Rama Setu Protection Movement and Director, Sarasvati Research Centre of Akhila Bharatiya Itihasa Sankalana Yojana. He has a Ph.D. in Public Administration from the Univ. of Philippines and degree in Economics and Statistics from Annamalai University.

Which spawns an unbroken current of samsaric (illusion) evolution, so the root source of error among sentient beings is thus unconscious ignorance Raghu suggests this is pretty good motivation for spiritual practice. Ram Dass gives another motivation, which is, change generates fear. Fear generates contraction, contraction then generates prejudice and bigotry, and ultimately violence. What\\u2019s the antidote for this? It\\u2019s consciousness that does not respond to change with fear. So how do we get that consciousness? It takes spiritual practice. Once you start to practice, the journey to awakening starts to dominate the terrain. \\u201cEverything in your life becomes grist for the mill of awakening. You learn to trust the deepest inner message you can hear.\\u201d Ram Dass also says: \\u201cif you\\u2019re thinking you should meditate, don\\u2019t bother, go out and lust some more. You need an honest approach to the path, you can\\u2019t be phony holy.\\u201d Raghu talks about his own experience on sitting on a regular basis, even if he\\u2019s tired or cranky.

Light is what you concentrate when you concentrate. When you get distracted it's what gets yanked around. Light is mostly under the control of habit and desire. It's tricky. It's formless. Like a cloud or a blob of water. It can take all kinds of shapes and move all kinds of ways. It's what we manipulate in meditation.

Today\\u2019s caller, Scott, is concerned about how his parents will react when he shares a childhood secret with them. He is asking for guidance on how to approach the subject without upsetting them. If you relate to holding in a secret, or things you do not want to say or do not know how to bring forward you will find this conversation helpful. Revealing secrets is difficult for many of us. Sometimes it is easier to keep things brushed under the rug when we do not want to deal with a particular conversation. But, secrets can be toxic and carry shame. Do I believe that we should tell the people we love everything? I don\\u2019t know. Not always. But, when it is something we allow to perpetuate a pattern that protects others, especially our parents, above speaking our truth, often the truth will prevail. When we speak our truth we must do it with love. Protecting our children is one thing, but protecting our parents is a different conversation. If we are trying to protect our parents, we are taking on the parental role. I\\u2019m not saying that we should not consider their emotions. However, if we have a pattern of being the parent, and worrying about our parents while sacrificing our truth and our vulnerability, it is different. Your beloved exists.

Did you grow up feeling alone? Were you the person who had to protect family members or parent your parents? Are you ready to break patterns that don\\u2019t serve you anymore? Scott\\u2019s Question: Scott is looking for guidance about sharing a secret with his family he has had since childhood but does not want to upset them. Scott\\u2019s Key Insights and Ahas: He fears the shame and blame associated with sharing his secret. His story will soon be widely shared. He wants to protect his family. He is speaking with a professional therapist. He feels it is an important part of his story. He felt he had to be brave for his family. He stays away from his family and feels alone. He felt he had to parent his parents. He finally feels seen. He does not want to hide any longer. How to Get Over It and On With It: Be aware he can not control someone else\\u2019s feelings. Deliver his secret from a loving place. Tell his parents about his loneliness. Be authentic, loving, and vulnerable when he speaks with his parents. Ask Yourself: Where are you not being authentic? Where are you not being vulnerable? Where are you not speaking your truth because you are too afraid of someone else\\u2019s reaction? In what ways were you not able to be a child in your relationship with your parents? How can you take your rightful place, as a child, within your family?

He proposes that if we want to see our world change, we must first recognize that we are all leading, and with that comes an immense responsibility to serve the good of all.\",\"620\":\"Subconscious Training program \\u25ba https:\\/\\/www.josephrodrigues.com\\/sub Try Audible and Get Two FREE Audiobooks \\u25ba https:\\/\\/amzn.to\\/2WrldV1 Get the Mind Map... \\u25ba http:\\/\\/www.josephrodrigues.com\\/download Instagram \\u25ba https:\\/\\/www.instagram.com\\/officialjosephrodrigues\\/ Social Media: Instagram \\u25ba https:\\/\\/www.instagram.com\\/officialjosephrodrigues\\/ Facebook \\u25ba https:\\/\\/www.facebook.com\\/officialjosephrodrigues\\/ iTunes \\u25ba https:\\/\\/itunes.apple.com\\/us\\/podcast\\/insights-perspectives\\/id1248981048?mt=2 Stitcher \\u25bahttps:\\/\\/www.stitcher.com\\/podcast\\/joseph-rodrigues\\/insights-perspectives Links: Accessing IDEAL STATES of MIND (NLP Submodalities to LIVE IN THE END) https:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?v=8xFzvg5MKAo\",\"4884\":\"Thank you Prime Minister @JugnauthKumar!

It means that when intense longing for God replaces all worldly desires of the mind, one realizes him and gets his vision and divine touch. Sri Krishna said in the Gita, \\u2018Abandoning all duties, take refuge in me alone.\\u2019 [18.66] Self-surrender, self-surrender, self-surrender\\u2014there is no other way. In this kali yuga [iron age] human beings are short-lived and depend on food. They have to do many things in this short span of life. People have very little energy, strength, renunciation, forbearance, or courage. Their minds are weak and they naturally run after enjoyments. In spite of all these handicaps, one will have to realize God. Otherwise this precious life will pass in vain without one\\u2019s accomplishing anything. Surrender to God and wait for his grace\\u2014that is the easiest way in this age. What do we understand by the word self-surrender? Does it mean that we do not have to do anything\\u2014that we may sit idly without moving our hands or feet? No, it is not so. One should always sincerely pray: \\u2018O Lord, I do not know what is good and what is bad. I am solely dependent on you. Grant me all that I need. Take me along the path that will bring me the greatest good. Grant me purity and strength so that I may have constant recollectedness of you.\\u2019 Is it so easy to surrender oneself to God? Verbally many say: \\u2018We have surrendered ourselves to God. We are doing what he is making us do.\\u2019 But when we observe their lives, we see that their actions are quite contrary to what they say. If they do anything good, they take the credit for it themselves. They say with pride, \\u2018We did it, we did it.\\u2019 But if there is any mishap, they blame God and say, \\u2018He is giving us trouble and suffering.\\u2019 Most people behave this way. We judge people by seeing their exteriors, but God is all-knowing, and he looks into their minds. He rushes to that person who calls on him sincerely even once. Be simple. Unite your mind and speech. There is no partiality in his kingdom. . . . There is no dearth of divine grace. People are not eager to receive God\\u2019s grace, nor have they eyes to see his mercy. They only speak big words. Who wants God? Many people spend their lives talking high philosophy, but few practice religion. \\u2018Gurus are available by hundreds, but rare indeed is a true disciple.\\u2019 There are many people around to give advice, but who will follow it? Miseries and doubts cease for that person who follows the teachings of his guru with faith and love. He will not have to run here and there with a restless mind. God supplies all his needs and guides him in the right direction, holding his hand. There need be no anxiety for the one who has been blessed in this way. One among millions of people is endowed with noble desires, sublime thoughts, and good qualities. And again among such great souls only a few can stick to their ideals to the last. Those persons in whose minds good thoughts have already sprung up should try their utmost to strengthen them and make them permanent. Pray unceasingly: \\u2018Lord, bestow your grace on me. Give me strength so that I can realize you.\\u2019 \\u2013 Swami Brahmananda Belur Math, 1914 A Guide to Spiritual Life, p. 66-68 #Spirituality #Bhakti LET'S CONNECT!

Today\\u2019s caller, Lex, would like guidance with her patterns of inconsistency and quieting the harsh, critical voice of her mother in her head. This call will resonate with anyone who had a challenging, traumatic, dysfunctional, or abusive relationship with their mother. When we do not process our anger, it creates a rebel or saboteur within us. It is difficult to be consistent if we never had a model of a loving or consistent parent. We create a rebel to protect ourselves from emotional abuse and the rebel energy is often tied to anger. If you have a rebel or a self-sabotager, think about how it is anger in disguise. The more we deal with our anger and deal with the ways we have been abused, betrayed, or neglected, the less we rely on the rebel to protect us. If a child has a parent with a narcissistic personality disorder or is mentally abusive in some way, the child knows kindness can\\u2019t be trusted. They have to walk on eggshells all the time. So, when kind loving energy does come it is difficult to be open to it and trust it. Even though deep down we all trust feminine energy, deeply-ingrained patterns can confuse it with past experiences with females in our past. Your beloved exists.

Do you have an inner rebel and every time you get consistent about something that rebel comes in and just throws you off track? Did you have a parent that stood by when your other parent abused you or didn\\u2019t treat you well and it made you feel like you just weren\\u2019t protected? Do you struggle with trusting yourself or other people? Lex\\u2019s Question: Lex is looking for guidance on how to be consistent with her health routine. Lex\\u2019s Key Insights and Ahas: She is concerned about her health and weight. She suffers from Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). She wants people to think about her positively. She is inconsistent and self-sabotages herself. People treat her differently because of her physical appearance. Her mother had narcissistic tendencies. Her father didn\\u2019t offer her safety from her mother. She is passionate about justice and human rights. She wasn\\u2019t nurtured in her childhood. She has perfectionistic tendencies. She doesn\\u2019t feel enough and doesn\\u2019t trust. She was triggered by meditation. Her inner rebel helps her to survive and protects her. She gets stuck in a cycle of pushing, rebelling, and hopelessness. How to Get Over It and On With It: Call in nurturing, mothering energy. Look for guides to help her find her voice, her sovereignty. Listen to and surround herself with feminine voices. Deal with the anger she feels toward her mother through emotional release writing. Do the temper-tantrum technique from Expectation Hangover or Personal Mastery. Find a therapist who works with somatic, trauma, or behavioral therapy. When she hears her inner critic speak up, recognize it, and comfort herself. Ask Yourself: If you resonate with wanting to draw in more of the feminine voice and you want to find your loving, nurturing feminine side, surround yourself with loving, nurturing feminine energy voices. Have a conversation with your rebel, ask it what it is protecting you from. Do anger release work to see if you are rebelling because you are angry.

From his first-hand life experiences, he brings us glimpses the amazing land that India is. Within the cultural fabric of India, says he, is an underlying idea of oneness of all life. With examples from life, culture, politics, etc., he demolishes the misconceptions about India that were created primarily by Eurocentric ideologies and Semitic religions. His own life experiences are testimony to the tolerant, secular fabric of the Indian society. He asserts that through history, all ideologies and religions have found safe haven in this country, that untouchability, casteism and violence are not a part of our culture, and that all in all, it is an amazing land, this Amazing India.

He did his PhD and then happened to read a book by Girish Panjkaj \\u2018Autobiography of a Cow\\u2019 which changed everything for him.

After a deep dive into the Ram Dass audio archives, Raghu gives us a preview of the never before published Ram Dass content. Being Here Now is an eight-week audio course with a companion guide written by Rameshwar Das. The course also features a big bonus current video of Ram Dass. Raghu gives us a taste of each week, and shares wisdom on some of the topics featured in the course. This course is brought to you in partnership with Tami Simon and Sounds True. Being Here Now: An Odyssey into the Essential Teachings of Ram Dass Identifying with Our True Self From the moment we incarnate as a human being we are identified with our body, feelings and thoughts. Yet, beyond our thinking mind and sensory perceptions, there is a vast realm of the soul which is pure consciousness, love, joy and peace. Our individual soul is part of that unitary consciousness, whether we call it God, Buddhahood, or the One. It is our origin and where we shall return. Sometimes just a subtle shift in perspective or point of view can remind us of this true nature of our being. Witness and Awareness The gateway to our true Self is our own awareness. Becoming an impartial observer of each instant of our incarnation allows us to be present in the moment and at the same time to extricate from our desires, thoughts, attachments and the time-binding of regrets about the past and worry about the future. Awareness and love, loving ourselves with full awareness of each thought and feeling, even of negative emotions, begins to dissolve our identification with the ego and allows us to live in our soul. Methods and Purifying the Mind Meditation means going within to bring the mind to one point in order to quiet the cacophony of thoughts, emotions, and desires. Patanjali, the sage who wrote the Yoga Sutra, starts with, \\u201cCitta vritti nirodha,\\u201d or, consciousness arises when thoughts dissolve. Our guru, Maharaj-ji, said, \\u201cBring your mind to one point and wait for Grace.\\u201d There are many methods of meditation. Find one that works for you and develop a regular practice. Suffering and Disturbing Emotions Physical, emotional, and mental suffering is a reality of life. Thoughts, emotions, and sensations come up constantly to disturb the essential peace of the heart and mind. While we cannot avoid the difficult challenges of life, how we deal with and experience them can magnify or reduce their impact. We can find a spaciousness in our encounters with suffering- we can actually make friends with our suffering. Cultivating Love and Compassion Love is the emotion of merging, or becoming one. Compassion is being with another\\u2019s suffering, experiencing our inter-relatedness in the most direct way by opening our hearts to one another. The Buddhist practice of metta or the Hindu devotional practices of Bhakti yoga can help with that heart opening. Ram Dass teaches Loving Awareness meditation that brings together love and awareness. We have to start from where we are. Only when we truly love ourselves can we become beacons of love to others. Relationships and the Spiritual Path Transforming the karma of relationships into grist for the mill of the spiritual path is a challenge. Discriminating between love and attachment, personal desire and unconditional love, is part of everyone\\u2019s spiritual evolution. Karma Yoga Transforming everyday work and activity into spiritual practice is karma yoga, often expressed through seva, or selfless service. The Bhagavad Gita is one of the great wisdom sources for karma yoga. As it says, ultimately we bring our lives into harmony by surrendering the fruits of our actions to God. Love and Death Our ego fears annihilation because of the identification with our body. Living in faith that we are truly a soul helps transform fear. The grief of losing a loved one yields to the certainty that though bodies pass away, love does not die. If we live fully in the present moment, death is just another moment.\",\"1005\":\"The roots of the present discontent. link.medium.com\\/LwL9w1Fk9cb\",\"1389\":\"\\ud83d\\udcd7 Order our Satvic Food Book : https:\\/\\/satvicmovement.org\\/foodbook \\ud83d\\ude4b\\ud83c\\udffb\\u200d\\u2642\\ufe0f Attend our next workshop : https:\\/\\/satvicmovement.org\\/workshops \\ud83d\\ude4b\\ud83c\\udffb\\u200d\\u2642\\ufe0f Attend the next juice fast : https:\\/\\/juiceon.satvicmovement.org \\ud83d\\udcf8 Connect on Instagram : http:\\/\\/instagram.com\\/satvicmovement ___________ \\u0907\\u0938 \\u0935\\u0940\\u0921\\u093f\\u092f\\u094b \\u092e\\u0947\\u0902 \\u0906\\u092a \\u0938\\u0940\\u0916\\u0947\\u0902\\u0917\\u0947 3 \\u091a\\u0940\\u095b\\u0947\\u0902 : 1) \\u0905\\u091a\\u094d\\u091b\\u0940 \\u092e\\u0942\\u0901\\u092b\\u0932\\u0940 \\u0915\\u0940 \\u0926\\u0939\\u0940 (peanut curd) \\u092c\\u0928\\u093e\\u0928\\u0947 \\u0915\\u093e \\u0924\\u0930\\u0940\\u0915\\u093e 2) \\u092e\\u0942\\u0901\\u092b\\u0932\\u0940 \\u0915\\u0940 \\u0926\\u0939\\u0940 \\u0915\\u0947 3 \\u0938\\u092c\\u0938\\u0947 \\u092c\\u095c\\u0947 \\u092b\\u093e\\u092f\\u0926\\u0947 3) \\u092e\\u0942\\u0901\\u092b\\u0932\\u0940 \\u0915\\u0940 \\u0926\\u0939\\u0940 \\u0938\\u0947 \\u0938\\u094d\\u0935\\u093e\\u0926\\u093f\\u0937\\u094d\\u091f \\u092a\\u093e\\u092a\\u095c\\u0940 \\u091a\\u093e\\u091f \\u0914\\u0930 \\u0915\\u095d\\u0940 \\u0915\\u0948\\u0938\\u0947 \\u092c\\u0928\\u093e\\u0924\\u0947 \\u0939\\u0948 ___________ In this video, you will learn 3 things : 1) Step-by-step process to make good peanut curd 2) Top 3 benefits of consuming peanut curd over dairy curd 3) How to make delicious papdi chaat and vegan kadhi using peanut curd Guess what?

It seems ineffective for me, but when I tell people that, the response is always that I just need to stick with it and do it consistently over time. Did that, got nothing out of it, stopped. Tried doing it again, got nothing out of it, stopped. And so on. I restarted it recently, but at this point, I have no real hope that it'll go well for me, and mostly just want to ensure that I've done what I'm supposed to do, i.e. sticking with it for longer than I ever have before, so that nobody can tell me I just haven't done it enough, and so that anybody who might've given me that advice will give me different advice instead.

Elizabeth calls in asking for daily mantras, actions, and tools to help her feel worthy of a loving relationship. She is struggling with enoughness. She wants to get over a \\u201ctoxic\\u201d relationship from her past and truly embrace, rather than sabotage, the healthy relationship she is in now. We get to the fundamental ouch or significant life event that created the misunderstanding that perpetuates her feelings of not being enough. The feeling of not-enoughness is a major human problem. Eventually, we will evolve out of this not-enoughness thinking and raise children differently so we all don\\u2019t have to have this major human epidemic. Know that by listening to this show, doing inner work, and feeding yourself the truth, you are doing your part to evolve human consciousness. Nothing outside of you can fulfill you and nothing external comes to you until you truly know that you are worthy and enough. That being said, we live in an interdependent world. And, although we cannot look to the outside world to make us happy, it is important to feel connected to others and attract and nurture healthy relationships, no matter where we are in our journey. The brain may confuse familiarity with love because it was wired from an early age to make love an equation. Many learn that if they act a certain way they will get love. Conditional love can feel familiar. But, worthiness is not conditional.

Do you doubt that the people in your life really love you and see you? Do you fear that you will not measure up in some way? Is there a fierce inner critic that lives inside your head? And, even though you know you should be nicer to yourself, you can\\u2019t seem to change your self-talk? Elizabeth\\u2019s Question: Elizabeth is searching for some daily mantras or actions that will make her feel enough and worthy. Elizabeth\\u2019s Key Insights and Ahas: She is having difficulty connecting her intellect with her heart. She feels not enough and that her life is pointless. She verbalizes the chaos she feels in her mind. She was in an eight-year \\u201ctoxic\\u201d relationship. She has \\u201clove\\u201d attached to feeling a certain way. She has trouble quieting her inner critic. How to Get Over It and On With It: Be in the present moment and feel her feelings. Stop and breathe when her mind starts racing. Realize nothing is wrong with her. Forgive herself for confusing familiarity with love. Give her inner critic a new job description. Practice release writing when her inner critic is bratty. Takeaways For You: If you struggle with not-enoughness, when you feel it coming on, stop and think that you are hungry for the truth. And then, feed yourself some truth. Watch your language and watch what you are affirming. Slow down! Drop in and breathe. Give things you want to shift a new job description and a new role.

These Mantras will give the benefit of \\\"Protection of Wealth, Prosperity and Happiness in Life\\\" and is recited in all auspicious occasions. These Mantras are recited as per the method followed in Tamil Nadu, India. PECULIARITY in reciting Ghana Patha of Sukla Yajur Veda: You can observe, the Dheerga svarita is also indicated by single svarita mark unlike Taittiriya Sakha of Krishna Yajur Veda. Further \\\"Gm k \\\" symbol is pronounced as \\\"Gs\\\" in this Saakha. While reciting Ghana Patha, the reverse order of the words, will be changed to \\\"Pada Paatha\\\" form, which complicates the Ghana recitation further.

In a \\\"good\\\" meditation session, we can fully focus on the breath (or however you meditate) for the entire session, and find a place of calm for the entire session. this has huge rewards. In a \\\"bad\\\" meditation session, the mind continuously leaves the calm and wanders, and we are repeatedly catching it, and pulling it back to a place of calm. We will often label this as \\\"less good\\\" The more we catch our mind and re-direct it to a place of controlled calm during meditation, the more we are \\\"flexing that control muscle\\\", building it, and we are creating a habit of catching and re-directing our thoughts, instead of having our thoughts direct us. This habit hopefully spills into our daily lives - when our thoughts start running away on us, we can mindfully pull them back to a controlled place.

How do Hindu, Americans and how should Hindus therefore present themselves to others?\\\" About the Speaker: Ramesh N. Rao is a professor of communication studies at Columbus State University. Having worked in India briefly as a bank officer, a schoolteacher, and a copy editor for a major newspaper, he decided to pursue further studies in the US, and earned his MS in Communication from the University of Southern Mississippi, and his PhD in Communication from Michigan State University. His PhD thesis was on the nature of power in hostage negotiations. Ramesh Rao has taught a variety of communication courses, from public speaking to intercultural communication, and from persuasion to mass communication for over thirty years, starting at Michigan State University and then at Truman State University in Missouri, Longwood University in Virginia, and now at Columbus State University in Georgia. He began writing for internet portals like Sulekha in the mid-1990s and considers himself one of the early \\\"internet warriors\\\" for the Indian cause. Having written for a variety of newspapers and magazines in the US, India, and the UK, Ramesh Rao now edits India Facts, offers advice to Sewa International on matters of media outreach and public relations, while continuing to teach at Columbus State University. Some of his writing is archived on his website. In terms of his academic research interests, Ramesh Rao has presented numerous papers on Indian American identity, the coverage of India and Hinduism in Western media, and the depiction of India and Hinduism in intercultural communication textbooks. He has co-authored a book on intercultural communication, titled Intercultural Communication: The Indian Context, and is working on another co-authored book, tentatively titled Drawing from the Past, Forging a Future \\u2013 A New Thrust for Indian Communication Research. Hindu identity and the Indian presence in the twenty-first century need to be carefully, assertively, and constructively presented to the global audience as the pressure builds up from aggressive political and religious ideologies and groups that seek to programmatically pursue their monopolistic and unsustainable agendas, Ramesh Rao believes. A member of the Indic Academy, Ramesh Rao is fond of playing and watching tennis, listening to Carnatic and Hindustani classical music, and occasionally foray into the kitchen to cook his favorite Mysuru region food. An avid reader, he keeps buying books that he hopes to, one day, when he retires, finish reading. Ramesh Rao lives in Fortson, GA, with his wife Sujaya. Their son Sudhanva is now a freshman at the University of Georgia where he is majoring in biochemistry and economics.

Think away everything. Analyse everything that comes in the mind by the sheer action of the will. Next, assert what we really are\\u2014existence, knowledge, and bliss\\u2014being, knowing, and loving. Holy meditation helps to burn out all mental impurities. \\\"I do not want to get material life, do not want the sense-life, but something higher.\\\" That is renunciation. Then, by the power of meditation, undo the mischief that has been done. In real meditation you forget the body. You may be cut to pieces and not feel it at all. You feel such pleasure in it. You become so light. This perfect rest we will get in meditation. Just as I sit down to meditate, all the vilest subjects in the world come up. The whole thing is nauseating. Why should the mind think thoughts I do not want it to think? I am as it were a slave to the mind. Meditation is a sort of prayer and prayer is meditation. The highest meditation is to think of nothing. If you can remain one moment without thought, great power will come. Meditation is the means of unification of the subject and object. Meditation means the mind is turned back upon itself. The mind stops all the thought-waves and the world stops. Your consciousness expands. Every time you meditate you will keep your growth. Meditation, you know, comes by a process imagination. You go through all these processes purification of the elements \\u2014 making the one melt the other, that into the next higher, that into mind, that into spirit, and then you are spirit. Meditative state is the highest state of existence. So long as there is desire, no real happiness can come. It is only the contemplative, witness-like study of objects that brings to us real enjoyment and happiness. The animal has its happiness in the senses, the man in his intellect, and the god in spiritual contemplation. It is only to the soul that has attained to this contemplative state that the world really becomes beautiful. To him who desires nothing, and does not mix himself up with them, the manifold changes of nature are one panorama of beauty and sublimity. Not even the deepest sleep will give you such a rest as meditation can. The mind goes on jumping even in deepest sleep. Just those few moments in meditation your brain has almost stopped. \\u2026 You forget the body. \\u2026 You feel such pleasure in it. You become so light. This perfect rest we will get in meditation. Om is the pointed piece and Dhy\\u00e2na (meditation) is the friction. Self-realization is to be attained by renunciation, by meditation\\u2014renunciation of all the senses, cutting the knots, the chains that bind us down to matter. The power of meditation gets us everything. If you want to get power over nature, [you can have it through meditation]. It is through the power of meditation all scientific facts are discovered today. They study the subject and forget everything, their own identity and everything, and then the great fact comes like a flash. Some people think that is inspiration. There is no more inspiration than there is expiration; and never was anything got for nothing. Thought ceases in meditation; even the mind's elements are quite quiet. Blood circulation stops. His breath stops, but he is not dead. To realize the spirit as spirit is practical religion. Everything else is good so far as it leads to this one grand idea. That realization is to be attained by renunciation, by meditation\\u2014renunciation of all the senses, cutting the knots, the chains that bind us down to matter. Whose meditation is real and effective? Who can really surrender to the will of God? Only the person whose mind has been purified by selfless work. Try a little harder, and meditation comes. You do not feel the body or anything else. When you come out of it after the hour, you have had the most beautiful rest you ever had in your life. That is the only way you ever give rest to your system. Not even the deepest sleep will give you such a rest as that. https:\\/\\/vivekavani.com\\/swami-vivekananda-quotes-meditation\\/ #Meditation\",\"77\":\"Ram Dass talks about disturbing emotions that may arise is potential wisdom the moment you relax into your natural mind.

Archaeology evidence demonstrates the presence of Human beings in India for the last 100,000+ years and the presence of agriculture for 20,000+ years. Astronomy evidence of the epics leads us to the 13th millennium BCE for Ramayana and the 6th millennium BCE for Mahabharata. However, we have scanty descriptions of what was happening in the other parts of the world and we know little of interactions between world civilizations of deep antiquity. Did our ancestors know of the areas outside Bharata and how much did they know of the world geography? Do we have reliable accounts of the knowledge of world geography in our ancient narratives and is it possible to test their validity? This presentation demonstrates an impressive knowledge of our ancestors of the world geography as early as 14,000+ years ago that not only is validated with empirical evidence but also corroborates what we know of the changes in ocean levels or the presence of human habitation in far off areas of the world.

Exercise didn\\u2019t work, ambient music did nothing but make me run to the Xbox controller to play Morrowind, it was genuinely after watching some movie with meditation in it that I decided to give it a chance. It changed my life and I\\u2019ve been meditating on and off ever since. I recently used an EEG device to find out how my brain changed during reading before and after I meditated. I found that meditating for 10 minutes was more effective at boosting concentration than 5 minutes of meditation and that 20 minutes of meditation was too much, making me feel too \\u201cfatigued\\u201d to effectively concentrate. Meditation for 5, 10 or 20 minutes was more effective than not meditating at all.

Dani calls in looking for guidance on how to get out of the funk she is in. She feels unmotivated and burned out. But, as we discuss, the beautiful thing about burnout is that it is a wake-up call to tell us we are living in an unsustainable way. It is in the unknown that magical opportunities present themselves. When we plan and control everything there is little room for the universe to surprise us. A lot of us are committed to personal growth. But, we must be aware of when we are working on ourselves a little too much and sometimes just let it be. Be in radical self-acceptance. Be in a place of just accepting where we are and shifting our energy into one of love and gratitude. It is the balance between not brushing stuff under the rug and living in denial but not overworking ourselves so we are always a personal growth project. When we grew up in a house where there was a lot of uncertainty or chaos there is a frenetic energy that happens. It is constantly looking for safety and certainty. It can keep us very busy. If you relate to that, I encourage you just to stop and slow down. Because our soul, or the universe, does not give us much momentum on something when it comes from a place of lack.

This term, and the real concerns it implies, are, however, denied legitimacy in most legitimizing institutions, including government, business, media, and education. In this talk, Professor Vamsee Juluri shows how Hinduphobia must be approached not like a conspiracy theory but as an object of study in the social sciences. The talk covers three broad areas. First, we examine the evidence to evaluate how successful, if at all, Hindu American advocacy efforts have been in advancing concerns about Hinduphobia, especially when compared to other anti-oppression concepts like racism, antisemitism, homophobia, and Islamophobia. Second, we review the history of the field of media studies so as to better understand the resistance to recognizing Hinduphobia as a valid object of study that exists in the field. Third, we outline a conceptual map for studying Hinduphobia in the field of media studies, including specific questions pertaining to media institutions, texts, and audiences. In this part, we also cover several examples of tropes and tactics that constitute Hinduphobia in media representations based on Prof. Juluri\\u2019s latest publication: \\u201cHindu Nationalism\\u201d or \\u201cHinduphobia\\u201d?: Ethnocentrism, Errors, and Bias in Media and Media Studies. In D. Sharma (Ed.). (, 2020). Ethics, Errors, and Ethnocentrism: Research in Social Science. New York: Routledge. Viewers of this talk can expect to learn how to talk about media depictions of Hinduism that are false, biased, or hateful in a professional, scholarly fashion that can help change the discourse about Hinduism in the media. About the Speaker: Professor Vamsee Juluri teaches Media Studies at the University of San Francisco and is the author of several books, including Becoming a Global Audience: Longing and Belonging in Indian Music Television (Peter Lang, 2003), The Mythologist: A Novel (Penguin India, 2010), Bollywood Nation: India through its Cinema (Penguin India, 2013), Rearming Hinduism: Nature, Hinduphobia and the Return of Indian Intelligence (Westland, 2015), Saraswati\\u2019s Intelligence (Westland, 2017), and The Firekeepers of Jwalapuram (Westland, 2020). The last two books are part of an ongoing fictional trilogy about Hanuman entitled The Kishkindha Chronicles.

When the colonizers left, India alone had the potential to become a world power. Thus, it was important for the British to have a rogue nation to contain India. The two nation-theory was their tool to achieve this aim.

I'd say it was less focusing on my breath as much as it was just observing my thoughts and, it's incredible to me how I've just let this mental clutter accumulate. There's no question that it's having a negative impact on my life, and in the back of my mind I knew meditating would help. So, that's what I did. The funny thing?

It is therefore imperative for all of us to revert to our indigenous organic way of life, Ayurvedic knowledge and traditional herbal medicines not only for ourselves but also for nature to sustain and regenerate. Dr Harinath Kasiganesan here makes a case study for the importance of the marvelous, super nutritious, Indian traditional herb and medicine 'Moringa Oleifera'. He researched about it and recommended its regular intake to his mother to help her recuperate and cope with allopathy induced serious side effects like gastric ulcers which she began experiencing while undergoing treatment for advanced arthritis and Spondylitis. In a short while it delivered really good results and made the saying true \\\"Food is Medicine\\\". Inspired by this and in order to study more about traditional use of herbs and organic agriculture as traditional medicine, he returned to India permanently and bought a plot of land in Tamil Nadu to grow chemical-free rare and forgotten grains, fruits and vegetables along with reaching out to local farming communities to teach them traditional methods of farming and also donated indigenous\\/local seeds to them for growing. He also invented a polyherbal-nutraceutical compound called \\\"Moringa Bullet\\\" made from fresh Moringa leaves and other traditional herbal concoctions that has worked wonders for people suffering from arthritis, anemia, diabetes, high blood pressure, etc. \\\"Nature has the solutions to all our problems\\\", Dr Harinath delivers this very message through his work and this tremendously informative and enlightening talk, delving further into Fertilizer Diet Vs Organic Soil-fed Diet, Immunity building, Nature Vs Manufacture, Sustainable Development Vs Unsustainable Development, Organic farming technicalities and its immense importance. For Dr. Harinath Kasiganesan's Moringa Bullet enquiries, please Whatsapp on: 91-8056170742 About the Speaker: Dr. Harinath Kasiganesan spent 12 years as a scientist in DRDO India and subsequently as a senior research facility at Medical University of South Carolina, Cardiology Department, USA for a decade. During his tenure abroad he was involved in the discovery of novel therapeutic drugs for human cardiac diseases. He has been awarded with several patents and scientific publications. A personal incident however, changed his approach altogether, pushing him toward a direction he probably wouldn't have thought of - the croplands of Tamil Nadu. Dr Harinath Kasiganesan's motto is 'Organic Farming is Soil Forming & Soil is Superior to the Crop' and advocates a societal mission to spread awareness about traditional herbal medicines & organic farming alongwith the understanding that farming is a science; it is a form of art, and it is a culture; it is a way to realize \\u2018Vasudeva Kutumbakam\\u2019, which means the whole world as one family.

In the first three talks she focused on: Understanding Maoism in India. This was an introductory session focusing on the basics of Maoism in India, its objectives, modus operandi, and history. Further, it analysed the impact of Maoism on the Human Rights of the Tribals and the other citizens of India. Second in the series was, Urban perspective of CPI (Maoist) and Elgar Parishad. Here, the speaker shared that Urban Maoism is not a new phenomenon. It has been there since the 70s. However, to sustain their base areas in jungles, the Maoists do need support from urban population. The talk will focus on the Maoists\\u2019 modus operandi in urban areas, case studies of some urban Maoists, the reasons behind the importance of urban areas for Maoists and some facts on the Elgar Parishad case. The third talk: Koregaon Bhima Riot - Fact vs Fiction detailed various aspects of this incident. On Jan 1, 2018 riots erupted in Koregaon Bhima. It was followed by caste based divisive agenda on the social media by a select few. After interviewing hundreds of villagers from the area, a report was published. This talk highlighted the findings of the report. It also included the events that led to the riot and ground reality vis-\\u00e0-vis what was projected in the media. The last talk here, is the Legal battle of Elgar Parishad case. On Jun 6 and Aug 18, 2018 some intellectuals were arrested for their association and active participation in conspiracy by CPI (Maoist), a proscribed terrorist organization. India witnessed an unprecedented legal battle and propaganda campaigns post those arrests. This lecture detailed the facts of this legal battle and the challenges it faced. Captain Smita Gaikwad discussed the years old Legal Battle of the Elgaar Parishad case, discussing the sequence of events, the agencies involved, the petition filed for SIT, the Chargesheets and the Bail pleas of the accused. About the Speaker: A former Army Officer and a research fellow on internal security issues, Capt. Smita Gaikwad has been a vociferous thought leader and strategic thinker, raising her voice about Urban Maoism and its threat to the nation. After a career in the Army, she has had a diverse experience in the corporate, social, research and education sectors as well.

I used to meditate a lot when I was younger, but got sick and fell out of practice a number of years ago and have since developed ADHD that's made it very difficult to stay focused and still through a session. All I've been able to feel when I meditate recently is the pull of everything outside my mind; my phone, people walking around the house, light itches, work. When I lose track of my practice and my thoughts wander like this, I have an unintended mantra of telling myself \\\"it's okay\\\" to just sit and exist. \\\"It's okay\\\" has become something of a short breath for me that brings me back into focus, even if it's just for a short time before I have to think \\\"it's okay\\\" again. I've been trying to go for about 10 minutes a day, and I'm struggling mightily even with that little bit. I feel like I'm saying \\\"it's okay\\\" so many times, partially as an indication of how many times my mind wanders completely and partially as a marker of how much work I have to do on my practice, that I'm starting to get a little discouraged. I'm not going to stop, though I know 5-10 minutes a day is pretty minuscule in terms of benefit, because I'm determined to deepen my practice, clear my mind, and go for longer periods. I suppose I'm not really looking for advice or anything, I just wanted to share and could use some words of strength. The hardest thing about this for me, since picking meditation back up, has been persevering through what feels like a number of useless sessions even though I know they aren't useless. My mind just feels extremely foggy and far gone right now and it's been extremely challenging trying to break the mold. I hope you're all well and safe!

As a young child I was known as the class clown but as the years went by I knew this consistent pressure on my chest, sweaty hands, the inability to sleep due to my racing head, always doubting myself, and feeling trapped were not normal. The first time I tried to seek help was in sixth grade and I decided I couldn't take it anymore and talked to a counselor. Obviously, a counselor isn't a therapist but I couldn't just stand there and just let my mind kick my ass every day. I hated the idea of seeking help but with my self worth down the drain, I decided why not. I talked with her for a week until she told me she had to tell my parents and I felt the color drain from my face. I was always the happy person around everyone and was terrified of what my parents would think. She called my parents and when I got home all hell broke loose. My parents told me everyone felt anxious at one point in life and that I was over my head. They said that only crazy people are happy all the time. As tears slipped into my dinner I decided to just return my mask of happiness to hide my sorrow. A few years after that, my anxiety worsened and every day was a battle. I again decided to talk to a counselor and told her I didn't want her to tell my parents and she agreed. I took her into my confidence and yet again another counselor told me that they needed to tell my parents ( I had not said anything about hurting me or others ). As I got home my mother started yelling at me at how terrible of a daughter I was and I was so obsessed with myself I had somehow convinced myself I had a disorder. I begged for professional help and that I'd even find a job to pay for it. She told me to get over it and I just went up to my room to sob in silence. With a sense of defeat, I decided to do anything to try to ground myself and or soothe myself. In the beginning, it was overindulging in food, which made me gain a lot of weight. It made me feel even worse about my self-worth but it made me feel a little bit better which was better than nothing. After seeing how much weight I had gained I stopped eating which started the history of my eating disorder which is another story for a different time. I quickly lost a tremendous amount of weight and became extremely skinny. I knew what I was doing was wrong but I was addicted to the empty feeling in my stomach and it was something I could feel grounded for once. After that was the cigarette addiction which gave me a 1-minute break from my head which was enough to convince me to start using. After that was self-harming. I started to cut myself to try to make everything seem all right and then came the idea that maybe life wasn't it for me. That all this suffering wasn't worth it and that the pain would all disappear if I just end it. I decided before I die before I make this unchangeable action to myself to at least try some things. I had tried about a million things to find a way to help my anxiety such as baths, journaling, church, exercising, free online therapists, etc. It seemed like the only thing I didn't try was meditation and in hindsight, it seemed kind of odd. Just sitting there swimming in your thoughts and trying to focus on your breathing. It seemed almost counteractive. But again who was I to judge it, someone who was truly thinking of ending it so I did it. I sat there and just focused on my breathing for about ten minutes and when I opened I felt something that seemed impossible, tranquility. I started crying of happiness not believing that something so simple could be the answer to years and years of pain. I sat there experiencing what I thought I could only experience in death. This was a few months ago and now I've been enjoying life with appreciating things I couldn't if I were in a grave. The birds singing in the morning or the sun kissing my cheeks. Meditating wasn't a simple fix to my entire life of course but it gave me something to cope with. I'm learning to deal with past traumas and how to deal with life. I owe meditating to saving my life and I wanted to write this to help others. Otherwise, I'm not sure I'd be here today.

There is a period for discussion after the talk. If you want to see if this group is for you, here are some pointers: This group is probably for you if: - You are interested in exploring Do Nothing (a.k.a. Shikantaza, Just Sitting) meditation. - You are struggling with over-efforting and striving in meditation and want to explore less strive-y and less effortful methods of meditation. - You are attracted to more secular approaches to contemplative life, such as those of J. Krishnamurti and Toni Packer. - You are open to incorporating philosophy, psychology and other related bodies of knowledge into meditation and meditative life. - You are open to exploring ways of cultivating contemplative life that are not centered around enlightenment or ending dukkha. This group is probably NOT for you if: - You are drawn to more hardcore, pragmatic dharma approaches, such as TMI, Mahasi style noting or Daniel Ingram-style rapid noting. - You are drawn to more map or stage-centered approaches to meditation, including those modeled on the \\\"progress of insight map\\\" and those that place emphasis on certain stages, such as A&P, Dark Night, etc. - You are attracted to more religious, less secular approaches to meditation, whether in the Buddhist tradition or outside of it. - You are looking to get stream entry or enlightenment and see joining groups like this one as a way of fostering skills that can help you get there. - You are looking to \\\"get rid of thoughts\\\", have a \\\"cessation\\\" or have a certain kind of experience that you believe is linked with a desirable state or outcome. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- If you're still on the fence, you can check out the stuff that I'm working on before joining by browsing my meditation blog here.

When you first meditate, you can feel many things, depending on your prior lifestyle: boredom, anxiety, relaxation, peace. As you practice more and more, you realize something: your thoughts are just thoughts. When you observe them, they stop being perceived an accurate representation of reality, and start to be perceived more as reactions to what goes around you. But before that happened, thoughts weren't just thoughts. They were your reality. So what happened in between, to make them just \\\"thoughts\\\", and not reality? *You* happened. Something slowly came into existence, that wasn't there before. A part of your brain started to receive signals from another part of your brain, and record them. That is basically what an observation is. Over time, the part of your brain that tunes into the rest of your brain becomes better and better at it, and its record grows and grows. Let's call it the \\\"Observer\\\". The Observer slowly creates a map of your mind, the inner world. It starts to recognize patterns, and begins to make deductions about the outer world, based on their effect on the inner world. As the Observer grows, it also starts to realize that some of the concepts about one's self are subjective, and disconnected from the biological reality of the body and the physical reality of the outer world, in that moment. As the Observer realizes these ungrounded concepts, they are already dissolved. The only thing that caused all this was one simple act of deprivation. Literally *nothing* was required for the individual's brain to completely restructure itself, gain awareness, and move to a position of higher stability and peace. The Observer did not exist before meditation. It was meditation which *created* the Observer. After meditation, a new entity comes into existence in the human mind---one that is more connected to the rest of the mind, to the body, and to the outer world. That is what is meant by \\\"finding yourself\\\" in the spiritual context. But that is a misdirection---the self mentioned here did *not* exist *before* meditation. And it was not exactly \\\"creation\\\" either, because that implies a *creator*, and the Observer cannot create itself before it exists. It is more like an ongoing bootstrapping. It is not binary---there is no exact moment when the Observer is 100% fully matured. The best analogy is birth. The Observer is *born* into the mind continuously, ever expanding and ever recording. You don't \\\"find\\\" yourself through meditation. You give birth to your *self* through meditation, over and over.

After a few hippie years, he did his Masters in Indology, Sinology, and Philosophy, followed by original fieldwork in BHU and Doctorate on Hindu nationalism. He has published numerous books and innumerable articles and has earned both laurels and ostracism with his findings on hot items like Islam, multiculturalism and the secular state, the roots of Indo-European, the Ayodhya temple, Mahatma Gandhi's legacy, the dark side of Buddhism, reinvention of Hinduism, Maoism, direct democracy, defense of threatened freedoms, and the Belgian question.

This is the style of writting where you just do 3 pages first thing every morning, without thinking about it too much, just writting whatever comes to your mind, every day for a while. You do not have to overthink it too much, just write whatever. I used to do this on the computer, but it is more effective when you do it by hand, there is more body-mind connection, and feels much more satisfying overall, you can focus on the tip of the pen and just write, witnessing the flow of words. I find it quite relaxing to develop and finish some thought that occured to me during the day, and see it finished and elaborated in a meaningful paragraph. The practice improves verbal fluency during everyday conversations. It is also great for memory recall. And overall, it just seems to give meaning to each passing day, no matter how bland or monotonous it is. In a way, it makes life seem more meaningful. During this period of lockdown, I also started going to psychotherapy, just talking with someone. It was also useful, because I gained some good advices from a Gestalt psychotherapist, the woman told me how to look at things from a different perspective, how to reevaluate some stuff in my life, and not see it from my limited, sometimes overly self-judgemental perspective. What I am trying to say with all of this, is that I saw some good stuff happening from listening to thoughts, trying to follow them down and write them down. And from disscussing these thoughts with others. And from trying to find more meaning in my life, and not just drowning in drugs, porn and alcohol. How does this relate to meditation? I stopped doing meditation with the ultimate goal of somehow transcending my perspective, that ego death kind of stuff. I also have to mention that I have a profound aversion toward this trend in meditation led by people like Sam Harris, that basically state that your ego is false, thoughts are a bunch of bullshit, and it is all completely predetermined. I have no use for this perspective. Thoughts are not just random bullshit, and when you write for a while, you can get surprised that you wrote some really useful insights, without thinking about it too much. It is not good to be consumed by thoughts, but it is also not good to disregard them. Why should I even try to be someone else? I just want to know and understand myself better. Why should not my perspective be valid? I want to see clearer, but it will always be my eyes. Can I ever not be subjective? Why should not my personal meaning be enough? Why should others tell me to blindly accept some vague belief that rests on a bunch of assumptions? In the end, this also gets tiring, and then it is great to meditate and not think.

The seals from Saravati-Sindhu Civilization from 3 century BC speak a lot about Bharat as a country rich in metal, material, alloys, cotton, silk, herbal products and developed agriculture. Evidence of cultivated land, water resources used productively, water management system by dividing into channels, storage reservoirs, drainage system are visible in Dholavira and other sites. Textile was well developed due to cotton cultivation, spinning, weaving and even dyeing with pigments was developed. The evidence of silk cultivation too has been found. The Sindhu-Sarasvati Civilization was also known as clothier of the world. The discovery of Tin bronze alloy resulting in to copper made the Neolithic age emerge in to copper age in the 4th Millennium BC. Dr S Kalyanaraman discusses in detail how invention of copper and iron\\/ steel created tools of agriculture like sickle, weapons and articles of daily use made Bharat a super power in terms of Metallurgy. The artisans were into gem crafting, metal working, pottery, dyeing textile, extraction from juices making the civilization into a highly sophisticated one. The Tin Bronze revolution also helped to develop Maritime routes of 3rd Millennium BC making Bharat a rich civilization About the Speaker: Dr. S.

I find that my thoughts are very verbal and sort of auditory, for whatever that's worth. My main form of meditation lately has been closing my eyes, focusing on my breathing, and redirecting my attention when I catch my thoughts straying. Seems good for attention\\/focus, but I sometimes find my breathing to be a tricky thing to focus on, as a) it's intermittent and b) it's affected by me being conscious of it.

Tldr at bottom. I've been meditating off and on for about 5 years. I know meditating can loosen\\/break up old trauma to be flushed out, and that can temporarily cause an increase in discomfort. I'm also aware of how sitting with uncomfortable feelings makes us more aware of them, so it can feel like we're more agitated but it's really just that we're noticing it more. But the issue I'm talking about is separate\\/in addition to those two things. Whenever I meditate daily, after 5-7 days I notice an increase in what I'd call my general agitation level. It's 24-7, and I feel angry, restless, irritable, and very hostile\\/aggressive. I also get insomnia and nightmares. This feeling increases every day I keep meditating, and only goes away when I stop (though it takes a few days to a few weeks to get back to normal.) I've tried to push through it a few times and keep going, but it just kept getting worse until I had to stop again. I don't drink, smoke, or eat fast\\/processed\\/junk food. I'm vegetarian and eat organic as much as possible. I'm on no prescription meds and I don't use drugs. I've been to therapy and it's been very helpful, but therapy didn't affect this either.

This is the first time a Vedic Chant of this kind is recited. Suresha Paddhati was first discovered during the year 2000 by Sri K Suresh during a Soma Yajna held in Thiruvaiyaaru, Tamil Nadu, India, and was first recognised by Sri PS Ananthanarayana Somayaji (Musiri) a renowned Vedic Scholar who named this unique method after its founder, Sri K.

However, due to the effects of colonialism, Hindus have become deracinated and have lost touch with this core of their civilization. The deracination is so deep that while detractors of Hinduism with ideological agendas continue to use Hindu Shastras, especially texts in the Dharmashastra tradition like Manusmriti as a tool to undermine Hinduism, the response from the Hindu side has been clumsy, disoriented, and one that involves denouncement of our Shastras as not relevant and outdated. This talk seeks to rectify this prevalent confusion and misconception among the Hindus through a presentation of the true role of texts like Manu and other Smritis as a Pramana-Shastra.

Included in the set were excerpts from a radio show he did that consisted of Q&A from audience members. It's amazing how relevant Ram Dass' answers to these questions are to our own very challenging contemporary times.\",\"49\":\"On this episode of Here and Now, Ram Dass has a Sunday hangout session with Raghu Markus. The two chat about the concept of the 'soul-complex', how Ram Dass manages his suffering, as well as duality and devotion. Ram Dass and Raghu discuss the 'soul-complex' and the transition process between lives. They also consider the similarities between duel and non-duel systems. Explaining how the limitations of one are complimented by the other, and how the two have different means to the same end. \\\"In life, the 'soul-complex' is never for two consecutive moments the same, but is, like the body, in constant change. There is thus a series of successive, and, in one sense, different states, which are in themselves but momentary. There is still a unifying bond in that each momentary state is a present representative of all those which are past, as it will be the generation of all future transformations potentially involved in it. This process is not interrupted by death.\\\"\",\"37\":\"The spiritual journey is a different path than what you thought you were on. It's very hard to make the transition to that path because we tend to take the power from the spiritual work we do to make our lives \\\"nice\\\" - but that's not what the path offers. The path offers freedom, but freedom demands complete surrender.

Kalyanaraman says Trade is a way of social interaction where people exchange goods. He goes on to give a detailed account of the seals and pictographs that decipher this aspect of Sarasvati -Sindhu Civilization. There is ample evidences for long distance trade transactions with India as centre point, the focus was on the Ancient maritime Tin route. The seals signify the metal trade ways of Meluha people through hieroglyphs depicting the Tin trade route of Bronze Age. The Meluhan merchants used the technology and wealth resources to trade across long distances. The goods were easily portable via navigable rivers like Sarasvati to sea with multiple ports along the way from western shores of India to Mesopotamia, right upto Israel. The breath taking discovery of Ayn Sukhna dated to 1900 BCE by a French marine archeology team establishes links of Kerala boat builders with Arabian gulf up to Egypt, the vessels that could carry upto twelve tons of goods. The Indus script narratives reveal the advanced metallurgical technology via seals, the copper metal infusion. The Harappan seals show silversmith and metal infusion that signify Alloy metals manufacturing. Similar activity is shown on a brass seal from Greece pictographs too that are actually text messages. It is wonderful to note how this language evolution took place, a unified language with different dialects. The metal ores, gems etc. were used as tribute by Meluhan merchants to traders in distant lands. So the trade contacts across seas and highly advanced technology and metal infusion are clearly evident through the hieroglyphs. About the Speaker: Dr. S. Kalyanaraman is a life-member of and regular participant in the World Association of Vedic Studies. He has authored many books on Vedic studies and Saravati-Sindhu Civilization. He is National President of Rameshwaram Rama Setu Protection Movement and Director, Sarasvati Research Centre of Akhila Bharatiya Itihasa Sankalana Yojana. He has a Ph.D. in Public Administration from the Univ. of Philippines and degree in Economics and Statistics from Annamalai University.

The most impactful leaders have overcome personal strife, and Jesse Israel is no exception. Once at odds with bouts of anxiety and depression, today Jesse is an influential community leader. Co-founder Cantora Records, signing bands such as MGMT and Francis and the Lights, Jesse now leads some of the world's most innovative mass meditations, through The Big Quiet & Medi Club. And certified as a meditation teacher by 1 Giant Mind, he asks: are there boundaries to how far a teacher should go in revealing their personal vulnerabilities, while teaching and leading others? The discussion opens up a candid look at the growing trend in the wellness world to be profoundly open and vocal about one's vulnerabilities. How much is too much? As a veteran teacher and community leader himself, Jonni provides thoughtful insight on how one can lead and teach in the most human way, without losing sight of boundary and student need. Taking the subject further, Jonni poses examples in which sharing vulnerability with students can be appropriate and effective. \\\"Vulnerability is not necessarily power, but instead a gateway to it.\\u201d In response, Jesse talks about his own experiences and relates what a minister once told him: \\u201cshare from the scar, not the wound.\\u201d Speak about your vulnerability from a place from empowerment, not of victimhood. This is a great episode for anyone trying to find that balance, as a teacher or as leader of any kind.\",\"167\":\"Change is an opportunity for growth, but it requires consciousness that holds an inner quality of equanimity and openness to the unknown.

This episode of the Here and Now Podcast is the first since Ram Dass recently left his body on December 22, 2019. It features a special message from Raghu Markus, long-time presenter of the show and dear friend to Ram Dass.\",\"378\":\"Do you know the value of positive thinking but just can\\u2019t seem to shift out of negative thinking? This coaching session is about expectations and shifting negative patterns. During this call, we examine Danielle\\u2019s past to understand what formed her current expectations and get to the root of why she is sabotaging herself in relationships. Any habituated response, feeling, or pattern of behavior you are currently engaged in was created a long time ago and you created it for a reason. If you really want to shift something you must get curious about the origin of it. Your expectations about what could or could not happen in your present or future life are based on what has happened in your past until you consciously choose to update them. Significant life events and\\/or repetitive events trigger us to form beliefs. These beliefs cause us to form expectations about life, others, and ourselves which impact our present and create our future. And, any \\u201cnegative\\u201d pattern we want to change has a payoff and usually can\\u2019t be changed overnight. That\\u2019s why it is important that we learn what the payoff is and learn how to get it in a more positive way. While it\\u2019s important not to become a victim in your life or be stuck in your story so much so that your past becomes an excuse or scapegoat for why you don\\u2019t have what you want, it is important to acknowledge it and understand how it is impacting you.

Is anxiety something you would like to feel less of? Do you desire a healthy, loving relationship? Are you the child of immigrants? Danielle\\u2019s Question: Danielle would like to know how to relieve herself of self-imposed anxiety and negative thinking in relationships and dating. Danielle\\u2019s Key Insights and Ahas: She has become comfortable with her negative thinking. She creates a frenzy inside of her. Her parents got divorced. She has fun memories of her childhood. She saw her parents fighting. She feels she needs to protect herself from being caught off guard. She used her negative thinking as a shield to feel safe but it also keeps love out. She is always in fight-or-flight mode. She is a first-generation Cuban American. She found her life coach through prayer and intention. She will change her inner dialogue. How to Get Over It and On With It: Identify her negative thinking, thank it for protecting her and ask her mind to help her to determine a true statement for what is happening. Consider attending the upcoming Personal Mastery Course and the Signature Retreat. Work with a healer to do some energetic bodywork. Cut some cords energetically. Takeaways: Be aware of what you affirm with your thoughts. Get curious about your past. What were the repetitive events or significant life events in your past that cause your expectations and how are they affecting your life now? Anything you would label as negative or a pattern you want to change, identify the payoff, and find a way to get that payoff in a more positive way. Always approach your growth, development, and healing with love and curiosity. Don\\u2019t be afraid to reach out for support. If you resonated with a lot of what came up in this coaching session, my Personal Mastery Course would be a great next step for you.

From ancient times there has been the idea of an elixir sometimes called Soma and the use of natural herbs to effect spiritual transformation. The experience that humans have is the ability to see the universe from a different vantage point- now we could experience the deeper part of our beings that lie behind the thinking mind. Our monitoring system gets turned off so we can have a completely fresh view. When the boundries break down we begin to see the inter-relatedness of everything. We see the way in which it\\u2019s all connected- the mystery that lies behind the apparent phenomena. These psychedelics give us an inner validity to our intuitive voice. Ram Dass talks about the original playbook laid out in the early days on set and setting when taking ethneogens. \\u201cWhen I broke through, what I saw was the reality I thought was real was only relatively real- not absolutely real.

I've tried almost every solution you can think of -- orthopedics, chiropractic, physiotherapists, massage sessions, yoga etc. but nothing ever seemed to work. I was desperate for a solution when a good friend recommended me these two products (am not affiliated to them in any way, just wanted to put it out there to help a fellow reddit friend) -- The first solution is a massage mat which derives its origins from an ancient Indian healing method which dates back to 5,000 years ago (https:\\/\\/the-orthorelief.com\\/products\\/orthorelief%E2%84%A2-acupressure-massage-mat). Simply by laying on this mat for 20 mins a day, you'll be in a deep state of relaxation, and this really helps to relieve any aches or pain from your neck, shoulder -- all the way to your upper and lower back. The second item that really helped me with my condition -- in particular my degenerative disks in the cervical region -- is this neck traction device (https:\\/\\/the-orthorelief.com\\/) which helps to relief pain by gently stretching your neck and spine.

It's the spontaneous way we respond to life and treat others, so long as we're not overwhelmed by fear. Jonni suggests that love is a self-referenced phenomenon.

There is a general sentiment of cultivating an attitude of openness, curiosity, non-judgment, and acceptance about the present. Would eagerness beforehand be inappropriate or considered a judgment when practicing mindfulness? In the sense that I'm excited to truly observe anything that comes up that I usually pay little mind to most of the time but not guiding the observations in a specific direction. I try to not have any reaction to what I notice during the actual practice, but is there any harm in having this generalized, positive predisposition toward mindfulness itself? Apologies if this is too meta or confusing, but what are your thoughts on having this eagerness not for anything in particular but life itself I guess? It just seems inevitable to have this kind of enthusiasm when practicing high openness and curiosity but perhaps not ideal in terms of judging the present.

It felt like falling into my own body without any control. As someone with control issues, this turned me off from meditating at all. Now that I'm in my 20's, I've been working on myself and my spirituality and I know that the next step is healing myself via meditation. A few nights ago I tried to do a past life regression meditation and it went well for the most part, however, I felt anxious the entire time as I had my eyes closed. I couldn't shake the feeling you'd get as a child hiding under the covers afraid to peek out into your dark bedroom. I really want to help myself heal and move forward from my traumas but it's hard when relaxing feels like a trap in itself. I struggle to relax outside of meditation as well and tend to constantly busy myself with tasks to avoid downtime.

The water (Aaapa:) after Indra's birth (Jaayamaanam) attend to Indra. These have been assigned (Anudaayee) the power of Indra : - (i) for slaying the Vrtha in all the Yajna (Satraa) and (ii) the lordship (Kshatra) and strength (Saha) to overcome the inimical men (nrushahye) with the help of Gods (Devebhi:) O, Indra, Lord of Yajna, I heard, (Ashravam) No one is like Indraani, and never at any time, her husband dies of old age.

Even if you haven\\u2019t had a breakup, this call is for anyone who is not where they want to be in life. It is a great example of what happens when we stay in the victim-perpetrator pattern. If you have been in a relationship or a situation you felt was a waste of time and wish you wouldn\\u2019t have done it, understand that it had happened to get you into the fast lane for healing. Issue-based relationships, even though they are difficult to go through, they jolt us into recognizing childhood wounds that need to be healed for us to have healthy adult relationships. If we want a healthy, authentic relationship that is not a repeat of our childhood issues, we need to do the inner work. There are no \\u201cblocks\\u201d to what we want, there are just unresolved issues to what we haven\\u2019t healed. We have to do the healing work before we can attract healthy things. Your beloved exists. Start cultivating the relationship now by signing up for the upcoming Be the Queen program. It includes live sessions and one-on-one support.

Do you beat yourself up for choices you made in the past that you have no control over changing now? Do you find yourself craving a family or a partner because you didn\\u2019t have a loving family? Do you have anger toward someone it is time to let go of? Leah\\u2019s Question: Leah would like guidance on how to get over a bad breakup and begin to manifest a healthy, long-term relationship. Leah\\u2019s Key Insights and Ahas: She was traumatized by a bad breakup two years ago. She is disappointed by the lack of progress in her personal development and healing work. Her parents divorced when she was young and there were no strong bonds formed with either of them. She resents her mother and feels neglected. She feels betrayed and used by her ex. She does not feel a deep connection to anyone since her ex. She is giving him a lot of power over her. She wants to work on trusting herself. She has done therapy but has difficulty sticking with it. She moves in between the victim and perpetrator archetypes. How to Get Over It and On With It: Do not take the situation personally. Realize her worthiness and value. Stop beating herself up. Release her anger by doing the Temper-tantrum and release writing practice from Expectation Hangover. Join the Be the Queen program. Be grateful for the lesson and give herself what she needs. Stay in compassion when she feels helpless or hopeless. Work with someone who will follow her divine timing. Takeaways: Consider doing the anger release or the release writing practice and look at where you are in a victim and perpetrator pattern. Remember, if you are healing an aspect of yourself, you are not healing all of you.
