People use it for desktop as well and perform common tasks including casual gaming. To help make that possible, we are going to look at an app that allows you to run Windows games on FreeBSD. What is Homura? Homura is a tool that allows you to play Windows games on FreeBSD. It was inspired by Lutris. It allows you to install and manage several Windows game and game store launchers. It mainly uses Wine, but also comes with a number of fixes and workarounds to get the games working. Homura\\u2019s creator, Alexander Vereeken, said that he created the application because \\u201cwhen I started using FreeBSD, there was no useful utility to set up games or launcher in wine, so I created one myself.\\u201d At the time, Wine was the only option. The Linux version of Steam did not exist. Homura install list Here is a list of the things you can install with Homura: Anarchy Online Arc Bethesda launcher Blizzard launcher Diablo II Discord Drakensang Online GOG Growtopia League of Legends Origin launcher PokeMMO Pokemon Uranium RuneScape Steam Subway Surfers Teamspeak Tropix 2 UC Browser Uplay Wargaming Game Center Itch.io Homura is named after a character in an anime named Madoka Magica. It was originally hosted on GitHub before the creator moved to GitLab. It is currently hosted on Codeberg. Hopefully, it will stay there for now. Homura Installing Homura Game Launcher on BSD You can install Homura from the FreeBSD repo with this command: pkg install games\\/homura You can also build and install it from the ports collection using this command. cd \\/usr\\/ports\\/games\\/homura\\/ && make install clean Once it is installed, you can run Homura by selecting it from the menu or typing Homura in the command line. (The name must be capitalized in the terminal or it will not work.) If you install Steam via Homura, you need to launch it from Homura. If you launch it from the operating system\\u2019s menu, it won\\u2019t display currently. Steam\\u2019s library and store tabs are displayed by a built-in web browser. For some reason, that does not work on FreeBSD. But if you launch Steam from Homura\\u2019s menu, it will use a list mode that works without issue. Experience I installed Homura on GhostBSD and used it to install Steam. Afterward, I installed a couple of games to test it out. Not all of the games I tried worked, mainly because they tried to use or install a Windows-specific piece of software that was unavailable. However, I was able to play one of my favorite games, Microsoft\\u2019s Rise of Nations, without any issue. (My test turned into a couple of hours of gameplay.) Homura Main Menu I also tried to install the GOG launcher. For some reason, it didn\\u2019t work for me. The loading screen would pop up and nothing would happen. I\\u2019m planning to file an issue. I didn\\u2019t test any of the installer\\/launchers because I don\\u2019t use them. Final Thoughts Not everything worked smoothly with Homura, but I could play some of my favorite games. Rise of Nation on BSD This app is the classic case of a user who had a need and decided to fill it. In doing so, he makes life easier for others. Hopefully, this application will make it a little easier for people to start using FreeBSD as their operating system.

This sentiment is not only among the IT crowd but also architects, psychologists, businessmen(and women). A part of it stems from parents who want their kids to go abroad because their friend's kids went and a part of the people just want to leave India for whatever reason. My close social circle are all in India and none have gone abroad while they very easily can. Yet, it feels like ones ability is questioned just because they weren't able to (didn't want to) go abroad. People who've stayed back, returned or even currently abroad - - what are your thoughts?

You installed one or more operating systems in VirtualBox. While creating those virtual operating systems, you also created virtual hard disks for them in VirtualBox. You specified the maximum size of the virtual disk to say 15 or 20 GB but now after using it for some time, you realize that your virtual machine is running out of space. While there are ways to free up disk space on Ubuntu and other operating systems, a more robust way of handling the situation is to increase the disk size of your virtual machines created in VirtualBox. Yes, you can enlarge the virtual hard disk in VirtualBox even after creation. Although this is a safe and tested procedure, it is highly recommended to create a backup of your virtual machine before you perform such an action. How to enlarge VirtualBox disk size I will show you how to resize disk in VirtualBox graphically and via command line (for Linux geeks). Both methods are easy and straightforward. Method 1: Using the Virtual Media Manager in VirtualBox VirtualBox 6 added a graphical option for resizing virtual disks. You can find it at the file tab of VirtualBox home page.

Let\\u2019s go back to the pre-2010 era and enjoy the simplicity of feature phones but with a modern design with MuditaOS. There are a few open source mobile operating systems existing already. Let me add one more to this list. Unlike most other mobile operating systems, MuditaOS is not interested in serving smartphones. Let\\u2019s have a look at it. Meet MuditaOS: A minimalistic, yet powerful mobile operating system MuditaOS is a beautifully designed E Ink mobile operating system. You might have come across the E Ink display with electronic eBook readers like Kindle or Nook. The E Ink display itself is soothing to the eyes and MuditaOS makes it even more beautiful with its minimalist approach. Here are the components of a basic phone running MuditaOS: Home Screen (with clock and notification) Calls Phonebook Messaging Settings Music Player (Thanks goodness!) Alarm clock Calendar Meditation Timer Tools Onboarding Since this is all too 2007-ish, MuditaOS has a companion desktop application available to manage the phone. Mudita Center desktop app to manage your Mudita Phone Mudita Center application is available on Linux, Windows and macOS. Connecting the phone to the computer and using this application, you can do the following: Update MuditaOS Upload and manage audio on Pure Export notes and voice memos Create longer messages and notes (because typing on phone with limited keys is a pain) Synchronize calendar Use your phone as mobile hotspot (if you have the 3G\\/4G data connection) What devices are available? MuditaOS is specially created for their own Mudita Pure phones that come on pebble gray and charcoal black colors. The phones are water resistant with IP54 rating and though it supports 4G network, you cannot use internet on the phone. You\\u2019ll have to tether it with your computer to use the data network on the computer. It also has ultralow SAR antenna to minimize the mobile radiation exposure. Another good thing is that their speakers and microphones are by Harman so expect top quality audio. Here are more technical specifications: Processor: Arm Cortex-M7 600MHz, 512KB Tightly Coupled Memory (TCM) Memory: 16 MB SDRAM and 16 GB eMMC flash storage Network and connectivity: 2G, 3G, 4G\\/LTE, GSM, Bluetooth 4.2, USB type-C, No WiFi, no mobile data on the phone Display: 2.84\\u2019\\u2019 E Ink (600x480px), 16-grayscale, scratch resistant Weight: 140 g Sim card: 2 nano SIM card slots Audio: Loudspeaker, earspeaker & microphone by Harman, Audio playback format: MP3, WAV, FLAC, Headphone jack, Bluetooth audio playback Battery: ~1600mAh, Li-Po, replacable Sensors: Ambient Light You can preorder a Mudita Pure phone on the link below Keep in mind that pricing is astronomical compared to other feature phones. Pre-order Mudita Pure As of now, I am not aware of any device other than the ones from Mudita running MuditaOS. This is rather new on the scene. Conclusion The name Mudita is inspired by the Sanskrit word \\u2018Mudit\\u2019 which means \\u2018happy\\u2019. Recently when the developers open sourced their project they mentioned, \\u201copen-sourcing MuditaOS goes along the line of our \\u201cYou\\u2019re happy \\u2013 I\\u2019m Happy\\u201d philosophy\\u201d. I know that working on feature phones in the age of smartphones may sound like a bad idea but keep in mind that feature phones are still not obsolete. There is still market for these phones among older people and for people who don\\u2019t want to spend too much on phones just for making calls.\",\"867\":\"It is always handy to have a quick word lookup tool while browsing the web or reading an e-book. Quick Lookup is one such free and open-source tool to try. Whenever I come across a word that I don\\u2019t know the meaning of, I just open a new tab and search for the meaning. However, it is a hit and trial every time depending on what search engine you\\u2019re on. Even if you do get an idea for the meaning with a quick search, you do not get all the details required along with it. Especially, if you do not know the meaning of the word that describes your target word. You will end up performing another quick search. So, to get rid of all that hassle, a quick lookup tool should prove to be useful!

If you have Flatpak enabled, you can always use this command to install it: flatpak install flathub com.github.johnfactotum.QuickLookup You can learn more about using Flatpak in case you don\\u2019t know how about it. It is worth noting that if you want to select texts on your browser (or any other app) while using a Flatpak package and have it look for the meaning, you will have to type this command (launching it in the selection mode): flatpak run com.github.johnfactotum.QuickLookup --selection In either case, you can simply download the source archive and get it installed using the installation script. You can also run it without needing to install it by simply navigating the source folder and typing this command: gjs quick-lookup.js If you\\u2019ve installed it from source and want it to automatically fetch the text that you select on any app, you will have to launch it using the following command: quick-lookup --selection You also get an option to use the GNOME Builder if you\\u2019re familiar with it. For more details, you can check out its GitHub page. Quick Lookup Recommended Read: LanguageTool Review: Free and Open Source Grammar Checker LanguageTool is a free and open source proofreading software that checks the grammar, style and spelling in more than 20 languages. Closing Thoughts on Quick Look Quick Look is definitely a useful dictionary app (even without an offline functionality) to quickly look for the meanings of words\\/phrases. I\\u2019m not much into eBooks, but you can try using an eBook reader along with this app to quickly be able to decipher words. Personally, I like to use it while browsing the web. To make things convenient, I like to keep its Window on top of every window on my workspace. So, you can easily select a text and then click on it to get the meaning and continue working. An offline functionality would be great for users who do not spend most of their time online. But, for the time being, it\\u2019s only online. Have you tried something like Quick Look?

You can also instantly create references and bibliographies for your documents with Zotero. Usually, you can use any note taking app on Linux to collect and share your ideas. But, here, I want to share something tailored specifically to help you collect, organize, and share your research, i.e. Zotero. Zotero: Collect, Organize, & Share Research Zotero is a completely open-source project that you can find on GitHub. It aims to help you easily collect, organize, add notes, and share your research. And, all of that without being a cloud-based service, it is completely offline. So, your research notes belong to you. Of course, unless you want to sync it for collaboration purpose, for which you may have to refer the documentation. To give you a head start, you can either opt for a WebDAV storage or just create a Zotero account to sync and share your research easily. For instance, I created a Zotero account with the username ankush9, you can find my research collections (that I added to my publication) at https:\\/\\/www.zotero.org\\/ankush9 This makes it easy to share your organized research and you can choose what to share to your publication. Let me highlight the key features that you get with Zotero to help you decide if you need to try it out. Features of Zotero Ability to add information right from the web in a click using a browser extension Add notes for each information Supports adding tags Supports adding voice recording Add video recording as attachment Add software as attachment Store an email as attachment Store podcast as an attachment Add Blog Posts Add a link to file Create bibliography from item Offline snapshot storage (you can access the web pages you saved without needing an Internet connection) Ability to duplicate items Organize items in a library Offers a trash bin to delete your items and easily restore them if needed Synchronization support Ability to export data LibreOffice add-on available for integration Easily share your research using your Zotero profile link Cross-platform support If you just want to create quick bibliography, you can try their other tool, ZoteroBib. Recommended Read: 9 Best LaTeX Editors For Linux Once you get over the learning curve, there is nothing like LaTex. Here are the best LaTex editors for Linux and other systems. Installing Zotero on Linux It is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. For Linux, if you are using an Ubuntu-based distribution (or Ubuntu itself), you will get a deb file (maintained by a third-party) to download and install it. Installing a deb file is easy and it worked just fine on Pop OS 20.04. If you are using any other Linux distribution, you can extract the tarball and get it installed. You can follow the official installation instructions to proceed with the suitable method. Zotero Concluding Thoughts You get plenty of features to organize, share, cite, and collect resources for your search. With the support for audio, video, text, and link, it should be fit for almost everything. Of course, I would recommend this to a power user to make the most out of it. And, if you are someone who has previously use tree-view (mind map view) note taking tools, you know what to look for. What do you think about Zotero? If it\\u2019s not for you, what would you suggest as a better alternative to this?

You are free to self-host it or opt for their managed service for a fee. Slack is a useful and popular team communication app that potentially replaces emails for work. A lot of big and small teams use it, even we at It\\u2019s FOSS relied on Slack initially. However, we needed a good open-source alternative to Slack and that\\u2019s when we came across Rocket.Chat. Sure, there are several other open-source slack alternatives, but we opted for Rocket.Chat for its similarity with Slack and ease of deployment. Rocket.Chat: An Open Source Communication Platform Rocket.Chat is an open-source communication platform for team collaboration. You get all the essential features to facilitate proper communication along with the option to get started for free, opt for hosted service by the Rocket.Chat team or deploy it on your server. You can totally customize as per your requirements when deploying it on your server. No matter what you choose to do, the feature-set is impressive. Let us take a look at what it offers. Features of Rocket.Chat Rocket.Chat is a powerful and flexible team communication tool. Here\\u2019s what you can expect from it: Easy file sharing (drag and drop support) Audio file sharing support Video conferencing with Jitsi Meet integration Separate channels (private and public options) End-to-End encryption support Customize the theme of the service (including the ability to customize it) Guest access support Unlimited message history (depending on the storage of your server for self-managed setup) Broadcast channel support RSS Integration Several 3rd party app integration support White label (optional if you want a custom branding) Read receipt (Enterprise plan) Push notifications support Customizable user permission 24 x 7 Support (depending on the pricing plan) LiveChat integration support which you can add on your website Real-time translation Self-host support Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, and Linux) In addition to all the key points mentioned above, there are a lot of little nifty features that should come in useful in Rocket.Chat. Installing Rocket.Chat client on Linux If you have a Rocket.Chat instance deployed or hosted by Rocket Chat itself, you can access it through web browser, desktop clients and mobile apps. Can\\u2019t self-host Rocket.Chat? Let us help you Deploying open source applications and managing Linux servers takes some expertise and time. If you lack either but still want to have your own instance of open source software, we can help you out. With our new project, High on Cloud, you can leave the deployment and server management part to us while you focus on your work. On Linux, Rocket.Chat is available as a snap and a Flatpak package. You can go through our guides on using snap or Flatpak on Linux to get started. I would recommend installing it as a Flatpak (that\\u2019s how I use it) to get the latest version. Of course, if you prefer to use it as a snap package, you can go with that as well. In either case, you can explore the source code on their GitHub page if you need. Rocket.Chat My Thoughts on Using Rocket.Chat I\\u2019ve been using Rocket.Chat for quite a while now (for our internal communication at It\\u2019s FOSS). Even though I was not the one who deployed it on our server, the documentation hints at a swift process to set it up on your server. It supports automation tools like Ansible, Kubernetes, etc and also gives you the option to deploy it as a docker container directly. You will find plenty of administrative options to tweak the experience on your instance of Rocket.Chat. It is easy to customize many things even if you are not an expert at self-managed projects. Personally, I appreciate the ability to customize the theme (it is easy to add a dark mode toggle as well). You get all the essential options available on smartphone as well. Overall, it is indeed an exciting switch from Slack and it should be a similar experience for most of you. What do you think about Rocket.Chat? Do you prefer something else over Rocket.Chat?

I started my career about a year* ago at a startup company. I do a lot from HR to marketing and in between. And I loved it, because I wasn't sure what I wanted to and I enjoyed doing a bunch of different things. I got promoted within 6 - 7 months, got more responsibilities, more workload. Did not mind at all. I was learning so much and I loved it. I would work for hours in a state of flow. This was during lockdown and I had moved back with my parents where I had my own room and space which I believe increased my productivity. After couple of months I moved back to bangalore and stayed with a friend, we shared a room. I completely lost my drive to work and my theory was that it was because I didn't have my own space which made sense to me. I stopped working for hours, I just did NOT want to work. I did not want to open my laptop and do a billion things. Work was more or less the same as before so I couldn't understand what went wrong (other than the space thing) hence, within 2 - 3 months I moved out and got a place with my own room. Still nothing! I still don't want to work! Is it the lack of routine? Its only been a couple days since I moved in to the new place but I thought it would be like before again.. where I would just feel that rush again.. but nothing. I barely want to open my laptop. I have been slacking off so much (which is easy considering wfh) which is making me feel so guilty. On top of that I got a raise couple of months ago. I feel like I don't deserve it at all. Imposter syndrome? Idk. Everything else in my life is going well. I'm not dating but I'm perfectly happy, things are fine with family. I have amazing friends. I don't think I'm depressed. (although I have been through depression before, kind of up and down, is this a down?? I'm so restless and overwhelmed. I don't know what to do. :( [link] [comments]\",\"4441\":\"Anyone here who likes to do some leisure cycling in and around malleshwaram area in the evenings(or mornings perhaps)? Let's cycle together!

I am pretty much satisfied with Manjaro and Arch Linux, so I couldn\\u2019t care less until I came across Garuda Linux. This beautiful Linux distribution shows some promises. Garuda Linux is fairly new to the Linux world and is aiming to provide the greatest performance, offering all the modern and attractive features. Even though you can choose various desktop environments, it is clear that their flagship desktop is a heavily customized KDE Plasma with a dark, neon look. Cyberpunk, anyone? Its Ultimate edition is optimized for gaming, and the recently introduced Dragonized (Dr460nized) version is aesthetically \\u201clavish\\u201d. Arch Linux installation can be a milestone for many Linux users, let alone to optimize your system at the level that Garuda Linux offers behind the convenience of Calamares installer. As I like a more traditional desktop, I started to test the MATE version of Garuda Linux, but I ended up taking the screenshots to the beautiful Dragonized edition. Garuda Linux Review: Beauty and the Arch We made a video showing Garuda Linux in action. The video is not a review but it highlights the main features of Garuda Linux KDE edition. Subscribe to our YouTube channel for more Linux videos Now, let me my experience with Garuda Linux. There are so many desktop environment options available with Garuda Linux: KDE Plasma Xfce GNOME Cinnamon LXQt MATE Deepin UKUI Wayfire BSPWM i3WM I settled with MATE and KDE Plasma for my testing. I am including KDE screenshots because that\\u2019s the one which looks the most beautiful of them all, in my opinion. Easy installation with Calamares installer Though I encourage everyone to install Arch Linux the \\u201ctraditional\\u201d way as part of their learning process, I can understand that this task is time-consuming and intimidating to some users. Like the most popular Arch-based distribution Manjaro, Garuda Linux is up and running within a few clicks, thanks to Calamares installer. Garuda Installer B-tree file system (BTRFS) \\u201cBetter F S\\u201d as I prefer to pronounce it, might not be used by default to the majority of Linux distributions. It is more than a decade old and considered stable although. It was introduced to address a number of lacking features of the Linux file system like snapshots and checksums. Garuda Linux comes with BTRFS as the default filesystem. Automatic snapshots accessible from GRUB Garuda Linux is a bleeding edge rolling release and less tested software might break your system after an upgrade. Timeshift backs up the system automatically before each update, and you can access the latest 5 snapshots of your system directly from the GRUB. Now that\\u2019s something cool, right? Garuda Snapshots Pamac package manager Inherited from Manjaro, graphical package manager Pamac is a great alternative to command line package manager pacman. Support for the AUR is enabled by default, and you have also the option to enable Snap and Flatpak support. Garuda Pamac Garuda Assistant to easily access admin settings Garuda Assistant is a graphical interface that makes the operating system\\u2019s administrative tasks, a simple point and click process. In the example below, you can see how easy is to enable the systemd services. Garuda Assistant You can also use it to update your system, clear logs, remove database lock, refresh mirrorlists and edit repositories. It\\u2019s handy tool for those who don\\u2019t want to go into terminal. Garuda settings manager Manjaro Linux users will have a deja vu once they open Garuda Settings Manager, as it is identical to Manjaro Settings Manager. Though Arch wiki offers a solution to every problem, the convenience of selecting a different kernel or the proprietary Nvidia driver through Garuda settings manager is second to none. Garuda Settings Manager Garuda Gamer \\u2013 GUI for curated gaming packages Arch Linux is a distribution that made me to stop distrohopping but when it comes to gaming on Linux, my suggestion to a new Linux user is Pop OS. The package selection of the Garuda Gamer GUI can make the Linux gamers to chuckle when they open it. Garuda Gamer Trivia In Hindu mythology, Garuda is the king of birds and vehicle mount of Vishnu, one of the principal Hindu Gods. Garuda is a cultural symbol in India, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia and Indonesia. Now, you can understand why Garuda Linux uses a Hawk\\/Eagle-kind of bird for its logo and mascot. Conclusion Garuda Linux is one of the Linux distributions that represents a real passion from the developers side, and this can be observed from the amazing selection of tools, features and configurations. The focus on providing GUI applications for most common tasks makes Garuda Linux an ideal choice for users who want to try Arch Linux but not comfortable using terminal all the time. With only one extra repository on top of Arch Linux repos, it is very close to pure Arch. I have to admit that I was amazed by Garuda Linux, and definitely extend my testing period to unravel every hidden spot. Have you experienced Garuda Linux? How\\u2019s your experience with it? If not, after reading this Garuda Linux review, will you be willing to give it a try?\",\"3817\":\"Comments\",\"2377\":\"My m30s is dead because it was dropped in water and hard water residue left behind is overheating the phone (most likely) and it's not starting.

Personally, I utilize services like Feedly to keep up with the latest happenings across the globe. But, it is a web-based service offering some optional premium features that I may never require. So, I looked at some feed reader apps available for Linux and QuiteRSS seemed like an impressive solution as an alternative to web-based services. In this article, I\\u2019m going to share a few key highlights about QuiteRSS along with my experience with it. QuiteRSS: A simple RSS reader for Linux desktop QuiteRSS is a quite useful open-source feed reader that is absolutely free and easy to use. Yes, all you need to do is just grab the ULR of the feed and add it. It has most of the essential features that you would expect from a standard desktop-based RSS reader. This includes offline reading. You can download articles of your choice in a click and read it later even if you are not connected to the internet. Don\\u2019t worry about adding RSS feeds one by one in QuiteRSS. The Good thing is that you can import feed list in OPML file format and add a bunch of RSS sources without making lots of efforts. You can \\u2018add star\\u2019 to articles or add labels to them for organizing it better. As you can already notice from the screenshot above that it offers a minimal user experience, let me also mention some of the other features that you get with it. Features of QuiteRSS Embedded Browser Feed and news filters User labels User filters Theme options (Dark\\/others) Ability to customize fonts and colors System tray icon support Proxy configuration (optional) Feed import wizard Automatic update feed on startup Mark\\/Unmark Import\\/Export feeds (OPML files) Pop up notification on updates Sound notification support Quick news filter Quick search feature Cross-platform Portable version (Windows) In a nutshell, starting with filtering the feed to cleaning it up, you get all the useful abilities. You can also configure a proxy if that\\u2019s what you need. The embedded browser is really helpful to prevent switching back and forth to check out any linked resources in the feed stories. Considering it as a feature-rich cross-platform feed reader, every feature listed should come in handy. Installing QuiteRSS on Linux QuiteRSS is available in the universe repository of Ubuntu and you can install it using the following command: sudo apt install quiterss You might not get the latest version all the time from Ubuntu\\u2019s repositories. For that, you can easily add the official PPA in Ubuntu-based distributions: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:quiterss\\/quiterss sudo apt update sudo apt install quiterss It is also available to install on Fedora using the default repository. In addition to that, you can use Pacman command to install QuiteRSS on Arch Linux or get it from AUR. You can refer the official installation instructions to get started. If you\\u2019re curious, you can also check out their GitHub page. QuiteRSS My experience with QuiteRSS It is a simple feed reader with a clean user experience. You do not get a rich formatting for the RSS feed you follow but it is good enough for readable experience. I find the ability to add labels quite useful to be able to filter out the stories I\\u2019ve read and enjoyed. For some reason, whenever I minimize the application or switch the workspace, the application closes automatically. It does appear in the system tray, but I do want it to stay active unless I manually minimize it or close it. So, I have to re-launch every time I move from it. If you face this issue, you might want to head on to their GitHub page to raise a new issue (unless they are already working on a reported issue). The ability to switch themes (especially having a dark theme) is fantastic. You can also customize the fonts and colors to tweak the experience of your feed. Overall, it is a great feed reader to have on Linux. If you use QuiteRSS extensively or like the idea of this open source software, please consider making a donation to the project on the developer\\u2019s website. Have you tried it already? What do you think about QuiteRSS?

While the tax rates are high, there are a lot of ways to reduce your tax liability. For the FY 2020-2021, finance minister Nirmala Sitraman announced a new tax regime with more tax slabs and lower tax rates. Also, finance minister gave taxpayers a choice between the new regime and existing one, leaving it to them to decide which they would like to opt for. Since we are nearing the end of the FY, it is time to make a decision. If you are wondering how to go about figuring out which regime you should opt for, this post answers that question for you. \\u200b Current Tax System \\u2013 high rates but lot of options to reduce taxes : Over the years the government, through addition of clauses to the Income Tax Act, has given Indian taxpayers over 70 exemptions and deduction options through which they can bring down their taxable income and hence pay less. While exemptions are part of your salary, like the House Rent Allowance (HRA) and Leave Travel Allowance (LTA), deductions allow you to lower your tax amount by investing, saving or spending on specific items. The biggest section for deduction is Section 80c through which you can bring down your taxable income by Rs.1.5 lakh. Apart from this, there are several other sections that let you take tax deductions on things ranging from interest on your loans (home and education) to premiums you pay for health insurance. \\u200b Most common exemptions and deductions availed by Indian taxpayers: Exemptions: House Rent Allowance Leave Travel Allowance Mobile and Internet Reimbursement Food Coupons or Vouchers Company Leased Car Standard Deduction Uniform Allowance Leave En-cashment Deductions: Employee Provident Fund Public Provident Fund Voluntary Provident Fund ELSS (Equity Linked Saving Scheme) Life Insurance Premium Principal and Interest component of Home Loan Children Tuition Fees Health Insurance Premiums Investment in NPS Tuition fee for Children Saving Account Interest (upto 10K) \\u200b The combination of exemptions and deductions can bring down your taxable income by lakhs. However, it also means every year you have to find ways to optimize your salary and savings\\/investments so as to keep you taxable income to the minimum. \\u200b Enter new tax regime \\u2013 More slabs, lower tax rate but no way to reduce taxes: The new tax regime is different from the existing system in two aspects. One, in the new regime, the tax slabs have increased, accompanied by lowering of rates in the sub-Rs 15 lakh range. Two, all the exemptions and deductions that were being used by taxpayers in the existing regime won\\u2019t be available in the new regime. Here is a comparison between the old and new tax slabs. \\u200b Tax Slab(\\u20b9) Old Tax Rates New Tax Rates 0 \\u2013 2,50,000 0% 0% 2,50,000 \\u2013 5,00,000 5% 5% 5,00,000 \\u2013 7,50,000 20% 10% 7,50,000 \\u2013 10,00,000 20% 15% 10,00,000 \\u2013 12,50,000 30% 20% 12,50,000 \\u2013 15,00,000 30% 25% 15,00,000 & above 30% 30% \\u200b As you can see under the new system, income between Rs 5 lakh and 7.5 lakh would be taxed at 10 percent, while income between Rs 7.5 lakh to Rs 10 lakh would be taxed at 15 percent. This was 20 percent flat on the entire range for the existing regime. The earlier Rs 10 lakh+ slab where you paid 30 percent, has been broken into three parts with rates of 20 percent for Rs 10-12.5 lakh, 25 percent for Rs 12.5 lakh-15 lakh and then 30 percent for Rs 15 lakh and above. \\u200b So, which regime should one pick? Unfortunately, there is no single answer to this. While figuring out what option to go for might look complicated, if you approach it in a systematic way, it is not that difficult to figure out. Here is what you need to do \\u2013 Calculate all the exemptions that you are availing: If you are living on rent, you would be claiming HRA which is the biggest salary exemption one enjoys. Apart from that, other tax-free components include LTA, Food Bill, Phone Bills, etc. All these will become taxable if you choose to shift to the new tax regime. Look at the deductions that you claim: As a salaried employee, two deductions that you automatically get are standard deduction of Rs 50,000 and your contribution towards your Employee Provident Fund (EPF). In the new regime, you won\\u2019t be able to claim these deductions even though you will continue to contribute to EPF. Over and above, you cannot claim deductions against your home loan (if you have one) or insurance policies, which till now has helped to reduce your taxable income. Now, combine these exemptions and deductions and minus them from your salary to see what is your taxable income and what it would be if you let go of these deductions. This should be the deciding factor for which regime you should go for. You can use the simple calculator provided by Income Tax Official Website to calculate this yourself. https:\\/\\/www.incometaxindiaefiling.gov.in\\/Tax_Calculator\\/ \\u200b Final Note: If you are employed, your employer would have already asked for which regime you want to follow to deduct TDS accordingly. But you can change it during your final ITR filing in june\\/july if needed. But it would be better if you plan on it now and in case if it is old regime, you can invest on additional tax saving instruments as well. Caution: The regime you pick shouldn\\u2019t decide whether you should invest and get insurance. Achieving your life goals and securing your family\\u2019s future should be the reasons not the tax benefits you get from them.

A friend of a friend made lakhs of rupees by investing in Bitcoin and you want a piece of the action - before you start, it's important to understand how Bitcoin is taxed in India Is Bitcoin legal? Income Tax implications GST Implications Let's get into it! IS BITCOIN LEGAL IN INDIA? There is a lack of clarity over the status of Cryptocurrencies in India. The Supreme Court of India in 2020 overturned a decision of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) which prohibited Banks from dealing with Cryptocurrency exchanges, ruling that RBI cannot just curb trading of cryptocurrency through a circular - a law needs to be passed for this. However, Cryptocurrency regulations are still prohibitory, besides being difficult to comprehend. The Government of India has been sceptical of Cryptocurrency, oscillating between wanting to regulate and banning Cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies are not recognised as legal tender and though the exchanges are legal, the Government has made it very difficult for them to operate. While the Government wishes to actively encourage Blockchain technology, it has been resisting the popular usage of Cryptocurrency. Once the unit of account(s) of these transactions change from INR to any Cryptocurrency (say, BTC), then the possibility of recovery of tax would become farcical. A final decision in relation to the above is expected soon, considering the evidence to show that Cryptocurrencies have emerged as a hedge against the uncertainty raised by COVID-19. Several reports indicate that the Parliament is considering a Cryptocurrency bill. In India, the COVID-19 lockdown saw investors re-engage their interest in virtual currencies - enough to have the Income Tax authorities supposedly take a close look at Cryptocurrency exchanges and Crypto-investors. HOW ARE BITCOINS TAXED IN INDIA? While there may be a lack of clarity over the status of Cryptocurrencies in India, at the same time, the levy of tax on transactions cannot be explicitly ruled out. Accordingly, seeing how the Bitcoins were obtained by the taxpayer, tax on Bitcoins may be considered as follows: INCOME TAX The Indian Income Tax Laws have always sought to tax \\u2018Income\\u2019 received, irrespective of the form in which it is received by the taxpayer. A.BITCOIN MINING - BITCOINS AS A CAPITAL ASSET Bitcoins created by mining may be classified as self-generated Capital Assets. Subsequent transfer of such Bitcoins would therefore give rise to \\u2018Capital Gains\\u2019. However, one may note that the Cost of Acquisition of such Bitcoins cannot be determined as it is a self-generated Asset. Also, it does not fall under the provisions of Section 55 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 which specifically defines the Cost of Acquisition of certain self-generated Assets. Thus, following the Supreme Court decision in the case of CIT v. B.C.Srinivasa Shetty [1961] 128 ITR 294 (SC), the Capital Gains computation mechanism fails and no Capital Gains tax would arise on the mining of Bitcoins. BITCOINS AS INCOME FROM OTHER SOURCES: Considering the ambiguity in the Indian Income Tax Laws, it is also possible to take a contrary view and tax the entire value of Bitcoins created by mining under the head \\u2018Income From Other Sources\\u2019. B. BITCOIN WALLETS - BITCOINS AS CONSIDERATION FOR SELLING GOODS AND \\/ OR SERVICES: https:\\/\\/preview.redd.it\\/w8wn7tvl58c61.png?width=711&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd6a4f6f438b71c1c984a5816d971f090763076b Where Bitcoins are received as consideration for selling Goods and \\/ or Services, it would constitute income in the hands of the Recipient. Such payments received in the ordinary course of Business or Profession would be taxed under the head \\u2018Profits and Gains from Business or Profession\\u2019. BITCOINS HELD AS AN INVESTMENT: If Bitcoins have been obtained, held as an Investment and then transferred in exchange for real currency, the appreciation in value may constitute income in the hands of the Crypto-investor. Capital Gains Galactic Advisors' view on the matter is that it would be classified under Income from Capital Gains \\u200b Example 1 Ms. Krypto bought bitcoin on 5 February 2019 for USD 4,000 per Bitcoin. She bought 1.5 BTC in total (USD 6,000). She sells 1 Bitcoin on 15 January 2021 for USD 40,000. She continues to hold 0.5 BTC. https:\\/\\/preview.redd.it\\/77asukjo58c61.png?width=1307&format=png&auto=webp&s=52538f90d90463187bac540e3688c49550ab348d Tax on this amount of INR 26.28 lakh would be payable at slab rates. Example 2 Barney buys BTC for USD 3,000 per BTC on 1 January 2018. He buys 1.25 Bitcoin in total. He sells: 0.25 BTC on 30 December 2020 at USD 35,000 per BTC and 1 BTC on 10 February 2021 at USD 38,000 per BTC https:\\/\\/preview.redd.it\\/sfphdkgp58c61.png?width=1307&format=png&auto=webp&s=271e1a85933c4496e6f6f258a2b7d5d9651127cf https:\\/\\/preview.redd.it\\/rvpbajnq58c61.png?width=1442&format=png&auto=webp&s=703cb68912f342119bc4ea34557f499d534606c6 Rule 115 is used for conversion of Foreign currency earnings into INR. Tax is payable as under: Tax at slab rates on STCG of INR 5.92 lakh Tax at 20% on LTCG of INR 25.9 lakh Other Sources\\/ Business Income Taxation of cryptocurrencies is a complex matter with no concrete judicial precedents. In the future, the Income Tax Department may classify this under Income from other sources or speculative business. C. BITCOIN TRADING - As mentioned earlier, Bitcoin trading is the act of Buying Low and Selling High. The income arising out of such Bitcoin trading activity, in the ordinary course, would give rise to income from Business or Capital Gains.

GST Recently, the Central Economic Intelligence Bureau (CEIB), an arm of the union finance ministry conducted a study on levying Goods and Services Tax (GST) on Cryptocurrencies. It put forward a proposal to impose 18% GST on Bitcoin transactions. The CEIB informed the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) that the Government could potentially gain INR 7,200 Crore annually on Bitcoin trading. It suggested that Bitcoins may be categorized under the 'Intangible Assets' class and be treated as \\u2018Current Assets\\u2019. Subsequently, GST could be levied on all transactions on the margins made while trading in Bitcoins. In view of the above, the CBIC is mulling over preparing a detailed proposal to be put before the GST Council. \\u200b Planning on selling your bitcoin and not sure about tax implications?

If you are an experienced Linux user, you might be utilizing the terminal or the tweak tool to manage fonts on your Linux system. Honestly, no matter how useful the GNOME tweak tool is \\u2014 it could be a little too overwhelming just to manage fonts. So, a separate application would be perfectly fine to help you manage fonts. Font Manager: An Open-Source App To Help Manage Fonts Font Manager (that\\u2019s literally the name of the app) is a dedicated application to help you manage the fonts. You get the details of the font family, variations available, and the ability to filter and tweak based on their height, width, spacing, and more. Considering it is a simple app, you do not find a bunch of features but I\\u2019ll briefly highlight a few things below. Features of Font Manager Ability to add fonts Ability to remove fonts Easily filter fonts based on family, vendor, spacing, height, etc Tweak the scaling factor of fonts Adjust the anti-aliasing (softness\\/sharpness) of the font Add font sources to preview them before installing it Offers keyboard shortcuts to quickly manage things Google fonts integration available out-of-the-box Get detailed information on characters available in the family font, license, size of the font, vendor, file type, spacing, width, and style Overall, you can easily install or remove fonts. But, you get quite a few perks while managing the fonts as shown in the screenshot above. Installing Font Manager on Linux You get a variety of options (depending on the Linux distro you use) for installation. If you have an Ubuntu-based distro, you can easily add the PPA through the commands below to install font manager: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:font-manager\\/staging sudo apt update sudo apt install font-manager In case you\\u2019re not a fan of PPAs (which is how I prefer to install this), you can also install a Flatpak package available on any Linux distribution. You just need to enable Flatpak on your Linux system and then search for it on your software center (if it supports Flatpak integration) or just type in the following command to install it: flatpak install flathub org.gnome.FontManager In case you\\u2019re an Arch user, you can find the package in the AUR. For further installation instructions, you might want to refer its official website and the GitHub page. Download Font Manager Wrapping Up Font Manager is a simple solution for any GTK+ based desktop environment. Primarily for GNOME but you can also utilize it for other desktop environments as well. You get a lot of useful information while being able to add or remove fonts and it is clearly a no-nonsense font manager, I think. What do you think about Font Manager?

The easiest way that won\\u2019t affect your current operating system is to create a live USB of Fedora. An alternative way to try Fedora, is to get advantage of virtualization technology through an installation in VirtualBox. This way, you use Fedora like an application on your current operating system. This way, you can perform more thorough testing without messing up your current operating system. You can even copy your virtual setup and re-install it on some other system. Sounds handy? Let me show you how to do it. Installing Fedora in VirtualBox Let\\u2019s see the steps for installing Fedora Linux in Oracle VirtualBox. Step 1: Install VirtualBox If you haven\\u2019t already installed VirtualBox on your system, you can download it from the official website. You can find instructions for Windows, Mac OS and Linux. Ubuntu users can refer to this detailed tutorial on installing VirtualBox. Download VirtualBox Step 2: Download the Fedora ISO If you are not familiar with fedora, there are a few images to be aware of. Fedora IoT is to be used for scalable infrastructure, Fedora workstation is an image with a set of tools oriented for a desktop in a vanilla GNOME desktop environment and Fedora server as its name reveals, is tailored for a server or data center. If GNOME isn\\u2019t your first choice, you can download a spin of Fedora desktop with an alternative desktop environment. For this tutorial, I chose Fedora 33 with the GNOME desktop environment. Download Fedora Step 3: Create an empty virtual machine and configure it Fedora requires a minimum of 20GB disk space & 2GB RAM, to install and run successfully. Although double those amounts is recommended for a smoother user experience. Based on that I will create and configure the virtual machine. Start Virtual Box and click on New. Create a new virtual machine The most important option to pay attention, is the type to be set to Linux and the version to Fedora (64-bit). If you start typing Fedora at the name prompt, VirtualBox will automatically pick the correct settings for you. Although the name doesn\\u2019t have to be Fedora, it can be anything you like. If you have access to 32-bit version only, you need to enable virtualization technology on BIOS, if you have an AMD CPU it is called SVM. Worst-case scenario is that your CPU doesn\\u2019t support virtualization technology. If you are not sure, check this first. Once you have similar settings with me, click on the create button. Name your VM and assign it at least 3 GB RAM As mentioned before, you need at least 20 GB of disk space to be able to install Fedora. I have 32 GB of RAM on my system so I assigned 8 GB here. You should be fine with 3 GB of RAM. A word about RAM consumption, the RAM will only be consumed by the virtual machine when you are running it. Otherwise, it will be available for regular usage. Make sure that the rest of the settings match the example and click Create. Assign 15-20 GB of disk space in VDI format Before you click the start button of your virtual machine, you need to load the ISO as shown below [Optical Drive]. Add the Fedora ISO to optical drive storage As your virtual hard drive is empty, the virtual machine will boot from this ISO. Think of it as using a live USB or disk for installing Linux. Go to Settings and add ISO as optical drive Then, if you have a multi-core CPU it is recommended to assign 2 or more cores for your virtual machine. You may find the CPU cores under the system tab. When you configure your system click ok and start the virtual machine. Optional step: Assign number of CPU cores Once you have configured everything, click on the start button to begin the installation. Step 4: Install Fedora in VirtualBox If you have followed the process correctly, when you start the virtual machine you will boot directly from the ISO file. When you see a similar to below screen select Start Fedora, and press the enter key. Fedora running in live environment in virtual machine To start the installation dialog box, click on Install to Hard Drive. Click on \\u201cinstall to hard drive\\u201d Before you proceed to the installation, it is essential to define your keyboard layout, your timezone and finally where the operating system will be installed. Choose keyboard, time and date and then go to Installation Destination The partitioning process is straight forward. You made some free space as VDI earlier. It should be automatically recognized. Select your disk and set the storage configuration to automatic. Click on Done to go to the previous dialog box. Disk should be automatically recognized Once you have configured the above, click on \\u201cBegin Installation\\u201d. Begin installation of Fedora Now you just need to wait for five-six minutes for installation completion. Click on the \\u201cFinish installation\\u201d button when installation is finished. As a last step, you need to power off your system. If you are unfamiliar with the GNOME desktop environment you can do it like so. Turn off Fedora live environment after installation You have to manually unload the ISO file that you loaded at the initial steps. Remove Fedora ISO From Optical Drive The next time you start the virtual machine with Fedora, you will be prompted to create a user account and set your password for Fedora Linux. Use VirtualBox guest additions for additional features like clipboard sharing, folder sharing and more Guest Additions are designed to be installed inside a virtual machine post installation of the guest operating system. They contain device drivers and system applications that optimize the guest operating system for better performance and usability. The Guest Additions ISO file is mounted as a virtual CD-ROM in order to be installed. This is a straightforward process. Simply click on the devices tab and then click on \\u201cInsert Guest Additions CD image\\u201d You will be prompted to download the guest additions image, when prompt click on Download. Install VirtualBox Guest Additions Shared clipboard At some point you\\u2019ll need to move some content between your virtual machine and the host operating system. The shared clipboard\\/drag and drop support will allow you to copy items on one platform and paste them on the other. To enable this feature, choose Settings on the VirtualBox home page and follow the instructions as below. I find the Bidirectional option the most convenient. Enable clipboard sharing between guest and host systems Shared folders There are two types of shares: Permanent shares, that are saved with the Virtual Machine settings. Transient shares, that are disappear when the Virtual Machine is powered off. These can be created using a checkbox in the VirtualBox Manager. In this tutorial, I will make a permanent shared folder. In the VM settings add the host system folder you want to share and choose the name that you want to appear at your VM. The next time you start the virtual machine, the folder should appear as a network drive. Better video support While the virtual graphics card which Oracle VirtualBox provides all the basic features, the custom video drivers that are installed with the Guest Additions provide you with extra high and non-standard video modes, as well as accelerated video performance. Using Guest Additions, the guest OS\\u2019s resolution will dynamically resize as you adjust the VirtualBox window on your computer. Finally, Guest Additions can take advantage of your computer\\u2019s graphics card. If you\\u2019re a gamer or using productivity software in a WM, this makes a huge difference. USB and Network Devices sharing With VirtualBox, users have the ability to use a fully-functional operating system, without having to do the setup on different hardware. However, sharing USB and network devices between the host and guest machine is not as straightforward as it should be. To access USB devices, you will need to install the VirtualBox extension pack. Install VirtualBox Extensions pack This is for Linux only because I am using all this in Linux. In order for VirtualBox to have access to the USB subsystem, the user (on host system) running VirtualBox must belong to the vboxuser group. To do this, open up a terminal and issue the following command: sudo usermod -aG vboxusers 'your username' Once you run the command, you should either log out and log back in, or restart your host machine. At this step, plug in your USB stick and through your VM settings you should be able to find and add the medium as shown at the example. Your USB will be accessible the next time you start your virtual machine. Bonus Tip: Save and export the Virtual Machine so that you can use it later on any system You may want to use your virtual machine to another computer or it is time to build a new machine and you need to keep your virtual machine as it is. You can easily export your current setup and import it to another machine at a few easy steps. At the VirtualBox home panel, click on file and the export appliance. If you prefer keyboard shortcuts, you can simply click Ctrl+E. Choose the virtual machine you want to export and click on next. The Format option needs some attention. There are three different options of Open Virtualization Format 0.9, 1.0 and 2.0, which can be either ovf or ova extensions. With ovf extension, several files will be written separately, compared to ova extension, which combines all the files into one Open Virtualization Format archive. The default format, Open Virtualization Format 1.0, should be fine. To finish the process, click next and at the next dialog box click export. Conclusion By using a virtual machine you can\\u2019t just test an operating system but deploy a fully functioning system, equally comparable to a physical machine. Nowadays, hardware has become so powerful and affordable that most of its power is not being utilized. Through virtualization technology, you can use those wasted resources. The need for physical machines is reduced, and consequently the energy consumption is less. You can save money both from hardware and reduced running costs. On a larger scale, server virtualization is more of a basic requirement than an advanced concept. I hope you found this tutorial helpful in installing Fedora Linux in VirtualBox.

I had absolutely no idea about this disorder before I met and spent some time with this person and I didn't see it coming even though I did spot some red flags but I attributed them to other people who were involved in this person's life. Let's call this person 'X' from hereon. When I met 'X' I saw them talking to their father\\/partner etc on phone and X used to react very strongly and negatively. It was abnormal. Crying, hyperventilating, extreme aggression. Flared nostrils, red eyes, fuming. It was pretty scary. But when I talked to X about it they said certain things which I attributed to them(father etc) being at fault for treating X wrong. Anyway, after spending yearS with this X person for reasons that I won't go into right now, I find myself scared shitless and with no way out except maybe dying myself or if this said X person kills themselves (which is going to ruin my life anyway, mentally at least). I feel very alone. I can't confide in anyone. I don't have anyone as a support system. This is not an exaggeration btw. I have very little hopes (given the state of mental health awareness in india) but I just wanted to know if anyone has any experience of being with someone having BPD. Only those people will ever understand what people close to BPD patients go through. I'm literally at the rock bottom and scared for my life and my future.

The obvious answer is to use the diff command in Linux. The problem is that not everyone would be comfortable comparing files in Linux terminal. And the diff command output could be confusing for some. Take this diff command output for example: There is definitely a learning curve involved here. However, if you are using desktop Linux, you can use GUI applications to easily compare two files for any differences. There are several GUI diff tools available for Linux. I am going to highlight my favorite tool Meld in this week\\u2019s Linux application highlight. Meld: Visual Diff and Merge tool for Linux (and Windows) With Meld, you can compare two files in side by side view. Not only that, you may also modify the files to make changes accordingly. That\\u2019s what you would want to do in most situations, right? File Comparison Meld is also capable of comparing directories and show which files are different. It will also show while files are new or missing. Directory Comparison You may also use Meld for a three-way comparison. Three Way File Comparison The graphical side-by-side comparison helps in a number of situations. If you are a developer, you can use it to understand code patches. Meld also supports version control systems like Git, Mercurial, Subversion etc. Features of Meld The open source Meld tools has the following main features: Perform two and three-way difference comparison Edit files in-place and the difference comparison updates immediately Navigate between differences and conflicts Visualize global and local differences with insertions, changes and conflicts marked accordingly Use regex text filtering to ignore certain differences Syntax highlighting Compare two or three directories for newly added, missing and altered files Exclude some files from comparison Support for popular version control systems like Git, Mercurial, Bazaar and SVN Support for many international languages Open source GPL v2 license Available for Linux as well as Windows Installing Meld on Linux Meld is a popular application and it is available in the official repositories of most Linux distributions. Check your distribution\\u2019s software center and see if Meld is available. Meld In Ubuntu Software Center Alternatively, you can also use command line package manager of your distribution to install Meld. On Ubuntu, it is available in the Universe repository and can be installed using the apt command: sudo apt install meld You may find the source code of Meld on GNOME\\u2019s GitLab repository: Meld Source Code Worth it? I know that most modern open source code editors come with this feature but sometimes you just want a simple interface without the trouble of installing additional add-ons for comparing files. Meld provides you just that. Do you use some other tools for checking differences between files? Which tool would that be? What\\u2019s your experience with Meld, if you ever used it? The comment sections is all yours for sharing your opinion.\",\"856\":\"The rise of streaming services like Netflix made people speculate about the dim future of TV channels. While the newer generation might not watch TV anymore, TV channels are not out of fashion, yet. Many streaming services like Hulu and Hotstar include TV channels in their offering. TV channels are also utilizing live streaming to broadcast their content to viewers on the internet. Another way to watch live TV is by using IPTV. There are a number of TV channels available via IPTV so that viewers can use internet to watch the live broadcast. Some channels are available for free while some might require subscription. There have been a few applications on Linux to watch IPTV channels but most have been discontinued. Linux Mint team announced that they are working on a new app that will allow you to watch TV channels via IPTV on your Linux system. Hypnotix: New IPTV application under development Hypnotix is an IPTV streaming application with support for live TV, movies and series. It supports IPTV providers using M3U URL, Xtream API or local M3U playlist. If none of the above make sense to you, don\\u2019t worry. Hypnotix comes with FreeIPTV preconfigured. FreeIPTV is a project that has M3U for over 2,000 TV channels that are legally free to watch. Which means that you can get a huge list of freely available TV channels from all over the world. You can click on the country or region of your choice. It will show you the list of channels in the left sidebar. Clicking on a channel will start playing the content in the right sidebar. You can also go full screen with F or F11 keyboard shortcut or use the button in the application. There is also provision to handle VOD (Video on Demand) library but I couldn\\u2019t figure out a way to use it. Here are a few things to keep in mind: Viewing experience depends on your internet speed and the TV channels\\u2019 servers. Some TV channels might not work even if they are listed in the application. You may go back a few seconds or minutes but this depends upon the cache. You may also pause the live streaming and it will maintain a cache so that you can resume later. I don\\u2019t know how big the cache could be. There is no way to control the video streaming quality as you do on YouTube and other video streaming websites. You won\\u2019t get running program\\u2019s detail in the player. This is TV broadcast so you get to see the same ads that are broadcasted during program breaks. Streaming is cached Installing Hypnotix on Linux Hypnotix is still in beta phase of development. The .deb file for the beta version is available for testing. On Ubuntu and Debian-based distributions, you can install it from the DEB file. Download .DEB file for Hypnotix (Beta Version) As a reader notified, Hypnotix is now available in AUR for Arch Linux users. Please note that it requires Python 3 packages and which may not be available on Ubuntu 18.04 and Mint 19 versions due to dependency issues. If you have Python 3 installed on your system, you can download the dependency package from the link below. Download Python3-imdbpy Package More features to come Linux Mint development team plans to add more features in the future: EPG support (Live TV Program) PVR: pausing, time-shifting, recording, etc. Custom categories: To list channels in appropriate categories Favorites: so that you don\\u2019t have to search for your favorite channels all the time. Hiding unused content I like Linux Mint team. Unlike many other distributions, they are not just Ubuntu or Arch repackages with different theme and wallpapers. They put effort in developing not only the distribution but also applications like Hypnotix, Warpinator etc for their users. Other distribution maintainers should learn from Mint team. Hypnotix provides a way to watch the IPTV channels with a simple and easy to use interface. Personally, I don\\u2019t watch TV but I know many people do. Are you one of them? If yes, do you look forward to using it?

Let me show you how to install it and how to use it for making a live Linux disk. Etcher: An open source tool to flash Linux ISO on SD Cards & USB drives Etcher is an open-source project by Balena to help flash SD cards for Raspberry Pi. In fact, we used it in our tutorial on how to install Raspbian OS on a SD Card. Not just limited to SD Cards, you can also use Etcher to make a bootable USB drive just like we created a live USB of Manjaro in Linux with the help of it. Ever since its first release, Etcher caught the attention for its neat interface and simplicity of use. In this article, I will be focusing on the steps to help you install Etcher on Linux. And then, I\\u2019ll also show how to use it. Before I do that, let me give you an overview of the features it offers: Features of Etcher Validate drive before flashing Beautiful user interface Auto-detects USB drive\\/SD card to prevent wiping the HDD on your computer Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, and Linux) Fast flashing Simple three-step process On paper, you get everything one would need to flash OS images on an SD card and a USB drive. It is also exciting to know that they plan to add the support simultaneous writing to multiple devices as per their roadmap. Installing Etcher on Linux To get started, you have to grab the AppImage file that it offers (suitable for any Linux distribution) from its official website. You just need to head on to its homepage and download the one for your system (32-bit\\/64-bit): In my case, I got the 64-bit AppImage file for Ubuntu. You can go through our guide on using AppImage files on Linux, but I\\u2019ll give you a head start on what you need to do next. You need to give the file permissions to execute and you can do that by right-clicking on the AppImage file -\\/strongdiv class=\\\"wp-block-image\\\"figure class=\\\"aligncenter size-full\\\"img

I mean there is nothing wrong with the application switcher that you use with Alt+Tab keyboard shortcut in Ubuntu. However, if you are a tinkerer who wants to customize the look and feel of your GNOME desktop, including the task switcher and animation effects when launching or minimizing an app \\u2014 you might want to continue reading this article. Change GNOME Task Switcher to Windows 7 Style Effect Switching between running applications using the key bind Alt+Tab is fast but it may not be the most intuitive experience for some. You just get to cycle through a bunch of icons depending on the number of active applications. What if you want to change how the task switcher looks? Well, you can easily give it a look of Windows 7 Aero Flip 3D effect. And, here\\u2019s how it will look: It definitely looks interesting to have a different task switcher. Why? Just for fun or to share your desktop\\u2019s screenshot on Linux communities. Now, to get this on your GNOME desktop, here\\u2019s what you have to do: Step 1: Enable GNOME extensions if you haven\\u2019t already. You can follow our guide to learn how to use GNOME shell extensions. Step 2: Once you are done with the setup, you can proceed downloading and installing the Coverflow GNOME extension from GNOME extensions website. In case you haven\\u2019t installed the browser extension, you can just click on the link \\u201cClick here to install browser extension\\u201d from the notice as shown in the screenshot below. Step 3: Next, you just have to refresh the web page and enable the extension as shown in the screenshot below. You also get some customization options if you click on the \\u201cgear\\u201d icon right to the toggle button. Of course, depending on how fast you want it to be or how good you want it to look, you will have to adjust the animation speed accordingly. Next, why not some kind of cool effect when you interact with applications (minimize\\/close)? I have just the solution for you. Add Genie Animation Effect While Minimizing & Re-opening Applications There\\u2019s an interesting effect (sort of like genie popping out of a lamp) that you can add to see when you minimize or re-open an app. This also comes as a GNOME extension, so you do not need to do anything else to get started. You just have to head to the extensions page, which is Compiz alike Magic Lamp effect and then enable the extension to see it in action. Here\\u2019s how it looks in action: It would look even cooler if you switch the Ubuntu dock to the bottom. Exciting GNOME extensions, right? You can play around to tweak your GNOME experience using the GNOME tweaks app and install some beautiful icon themes or explore different options. How do you prefer to customize your GNOME experience? Is there any other cool GNOME extension or an app that you tend to utilize? Feel free to share your thoughts in the comments below.\",\"4067\":\"Don\\u2019t use a certain application anymore? Remove it. In fact, removing programs is one of the easiest ways to free up disk space on Ubuntu and keep your system clean. In this beginner\\u2019s tutorial, I\\u2019ll show you various ways of uninstalling software from Ubuntu. Did I say various ways? Yes, because there are various ways of installing applications in Ubuntu and hence various ways of removing them. You\\u2019ll learn to: Remove applications from Ubuntu Software Center (for desktop users) Remove applications using apt remove command Remove snap applications in command line (intermediate to advanced users) Let\\u2019s see these steps one by one. Method 1: Remove applications using Ubuntu Software Center Start the Software Center application. You should find it in the dock on the left side or search for it in the menu. You can see the installed applications in the Installed tab. List installed applications If you don\\u2019t see a program here, try to use the search feature. Search for installed applications When you open an installed application, you should see the option to remove it. Click on it. Removing installed applications It will ask for your account password. Enter it and the applications will be removed in seconds. This method works pretty well except in the case when Software Center is misbehaving (it does that a lot) or if the program is a software library or some other command line utility. You can always resort to the terminal in such cases. Method 2: Remove programs from Ubuntu using command line You know that you can use apt-get install or apt install for installing applications. For uninstalling, you don\\u2019t use the apt-get uninstall command but apt-get remove or apt remove. All you need to do is to use the command in the following fashion: sudo apt remove program_name You\\u2019ll be asked to enter your account password. When you enter it, nothing is visible on the screen. That\\u2019s normal. Just type it blindly and press enter. The program won\\u2019t be removed immediately. You need to confirm it. When it asks for your conformation, press the enter key or Y key: Keep in mind that you\\u2019ll have to use the exact package name in the apt remove command otherwise it will throw \\u2018unable to locate package error\\u2018. Don\\u2019t worry if you don\\u2019t remember the exact program name. You can utilize the super useful tab completion. It\\u2019s one of the most useful Linux command line tips that you must know. What you can do is to type the first few letters of the program you want to uninstall. And then hit the tab key. It will show all the installed packages that match those letters at the beginning of their names. When you see the desired package, you can type its complete name and remove it. What if you do not know the exact package name or even the starting letters? Well, you can list all the installed packages in Ubuntu and grep with whatever your memory serves. For example, the command below will show all the installed packages that have the string \\u2018my\\u2019 in its name anywhere, not just the beginning. apt list --installed | grep -i my That\\u2019s cool, isn\\u2019t it? Just be careful with the package name when using the remove command in Ubuntu. Tip: Using apt purge for removing package (advanced users) When you remove a package in Ubuntu, the packaged data is removed, but it may leave small, modified user configuration files. This is intentional because if you install the same program again, it would use those configuration files. If you want to remove it completely, you can use apt purge command. You can use it instead of apt remove command or after running the apt remove command. sudo apt purge program_name Keep in mind that the purge command won\\u2019t remove any data or configuration file stored in the home directory of a user. Method 3: Uninstall Snap applications in Ubuntu The previous method works with the DEB packages that you installed using apt command, software center or directly from the deb file. Ubuntu also has a new packaging system called Snap. Most of the software you find in the Ubuntu Software Center are in this Snap package format. You can remove these applications from the Ubuntu Software Center easily but if you want to use the command line, here\\u2019s what you should do. List all the snap applications installed to get the package name. snap list Now use the package name to remove the application from Ubuntu. You won\\u2019t be asked for confirmation before removal. sudo snap remove package_name Bonus Tip: Clean up your system with one magical command Alright! You learned to remove the applications. Now let me tell you about a simple command that cleans up leftover package traces like dependencies that are no longer used, old Linux kernel headers that won\\u2019t be used anymore. In the terminal, just run this command: sudo apt autoremove This is a safe command, and it will easily free up a few hundred MB\\u2019s of disk space. Conclusion You learned three ways of removing applications from Ubuntu Linux. I covered both GUI and command line methods so that you are aware of all the options. I hope you find this simple tutorial helpful as an Ubuntu beginner.

The first announcement came a decade back and six years down the line, Ubuntu closed the curtains on the project. What went wrong? How it started? Is Ubuntu Touch still alive? Let\\u2019s take a look at the history of Ubuntu Touch in chronological order. Shuttleworth Announced Ubuntu Touch The Ubuntu Touch project began with a blog post by Canonical founder Mark Shuttleworth. The blog post, dated October 31, 2011, started with a bold prediction: \\u201cBy 14.04 LTS Ubuntu will power tablets, phones, TVs and smart screens from the car to the office kitchen, and it will connect those devices cleanly and seamlessly to the desktop, the server and the cloud.\\u201d Shuttleworth went on to explain that this move would be accomplished mainly through the use of the company\\u2019s new desktop environment, Unity. (Unity was introduced in Ubuntu 10.10.) \\u201cUnity, the desktop interface in today\\u2019s Ubuntu 11.10, was designed with this specific vision in mind.\\u201d The whole idea behind Unity was to create an interface that would work on different screen resolutions. \\u201cUnity\\u2019s core elements are arranged in exactly the way we need to create coherence across all of those devices. This was the origin of the name Unity \\u2013 a single core interface framework, that scales across all screens, and supports all toolkits.\\u201d Shuttleworth said that this move was motivated by the increasing use of mobile devices. \\u201cMake no mistake \\u2013 just as the world is changing for manufacturers so is it changing for Linux distributions. Today, 70% of people in Egypt access the Internet solely via the phone. Even in the US that figure is a startling 25%.\\u201d Ubuntu Touch is Released to the World The Unity desktop environment was originally introduced in the netbook version of Ubuntu 10.10. However, the phone interface wouldn\\u2019t be seen by the public until 2013. Mark Shuttleworth demoed it at the 2013 CES. Ubuntu Touch 1.0 was baked into the Ubuntu 13.10 release. This version primarily supported \\u201cGalaxy Nexus and Nexus 4 phone\\u201d with other images being available, as well. The system requirements for Ubuntu Touch looked a little bit like this: Entry-level Ubuntu smartphoneHigh-end Ubuntu \\u201csuperphone\\u201dProcessor architecture1Ghz Cortex A9Quad-core A9 or Intel AtomMemory512MB \\u2013 1GBMin 1GBFlash storage4-8GB eMMC + SDMin 32GB eMMC + SDMulti-touchYesYesDesktop convergenceNoYes Convergence concept Note: The last item on the above list (desktop convergence) might be a new idea to some people. This meant that you could use your Ubuntu Touch device like a phone, but you could also hook it up to a display, keyboard, and mouse to use it as a desktop. Unfortunately, Ubuntu Touch never gained this feature. Ubuntu Tries to Crowdfund a Phone To show off what an ideal Ubuntu phone would look like, Canonical started a crowdfunding campaign to finance the Ubuntu Edge on July 22, 2013. The goal was to raise $32 million in a month to produce 40,000 devices. According to the campaign\\u2019s page, Canonical hoped to use the new device \\u201cto provide a low-volume, high-technology platform, crowdfunded by enthusiasts and mobile computing professionals. A pioneering project that accelerates the adoption of new technologies and drives them down into the mainstream.\\u201d The Ubuntu Edge was considered high-end at the time with the following specs: Mobile OSDual-boots Android and Ubuntu mobileDesktop OSUbuntu DesktopRAM4GBInternal storage128GBScreen720 x 1,280, 4.5 inchesProtectionSapphire GlassConnectivityDual-LTE, GSMSpeakersStereoBatterySilicon-anode Li-ionPrice$695 Interestingly, several large companies pledged money. For example, Bloomberg pledged $800,000. They made this pledge because they believed that Ubuntu Touch \\u201ccould benefit its clients and the future of mobile Relevant Products\\/Services computing.\\u201d Ultimately, the campaign didn\\u2019t reach its goal. It only reached $12.7 million or 37% of the goal. The amount raised was the biggest a crowdfunding campaign ever saw. Ubuntu Touch Goes into Production (Sort of) Though Canonical failed to make its own hardware, it continued working on the software part i.e., developing the Ubuntu Touch mobile operating system. Ubuntu Touch was released to device makers in 2014. That same year, two device makers committed to produce Ubuntu phones. These two companies, Chinese Meizu and Spanish BQ, weren\\u2019t exactly global household names, but Shuttleworth said that was all part of the plan. \\u201cWhile we\\u2019re happy to work with household names, we want to be involved with partners for whom we can be a significant part of their story, rather than being appended to the more complicated story of other brands.\\u201d Both companies produced and released several phones with Ubuntu Touch as the main operating system. BQ also released an Ubuntu Touch tablet. However, no other manufacturer signed up to make Ubuntu Touch devices. Canonical Discontinues Ubuntu Touch Unity 8 was in beta when Ubuntu discontinued Unity and Ubuntu Touch project In early April of 2017, Mark Shuttleworth made another announcement. After mentioning that Canonical had experienced an \\u201cexcellent quarter and excellent year\\u201d, Shuttleworth announced the end of the Ubuntu Touch and Unity. \\u201cI\\u2019m writing to let you know that we will end our investment in Unity8, the phone and convergence shell.\\u201d Instead, Canonical would focus on desktop Ubuntu. He continued: I took the view that, if convergence was the future and we could deliver it as free software, that would be widely appreciated both in the free software community and in the technology industry, where there is substantial frustration with the existing, closed, alternatives available to manufacturers. I was wrong on both counts. In the community, our efforts were seen fragmentation not innovation. And industry has not rallied to the possibility, instead taking a \\u2018better the devil you know\\u2019 approach to those form factors, or investing in home-grown platforms. What the Unity8 team has delivered so far is beautiful, usable and solid, but I respect that markets, and community, ultimately decide which products grow and which disappear. He closed by saying that it was a hard decision to make because of his strong belief in the future of convergence. The Community Keeps the Project Alive When Shuttleworth\\u2019s announcement hit the internet, all the supporters of Ubuntu Touch were shocked. Many were unsure of what would happen to the devices that they owned. Thankfully, the community came to the rescue. Shortly after Shuttleworth\\u2019s announcement, Marius Gripsg\\u00e5rd announced that the UBports team would be keeping Ubuntu Touch alive. UBports was already well known in the Ubuntu Touch community for their work on porting it to more devices. Several other projects tried to do the same with the desktop version of Unity, but most did not last long. One of them had the inventive name of Yunit but I guess it is not actively developed anymore. UBports is the only project that is keeping Ubuntu Touch alive by continuously working on its development. Epilogue Ubuntu Touch was not the success that Canonical wanted it to be. It was too early for the market. However, it did lay the groundwork for the Linux phones that we have now. I believe that the PinePhone and the Purism Librem 5 phone would not have come about without Ubuntu Touch sparking interest in a Linux phone. At the same time, the Canonical engineers and programmers solved problems that laid the groundwork for these modern phones. You don\\u2019t get successes without a few failures along the way.

We have two donors as of now and they're still in testing phase to see if they are eligible to donate. I request the ones who are willing to donate contact me via DM. Any blood group is accepted since we're replacing the spent blood from the blood bank. My grandma's blood group is A+, but any blood group is accepted. P.S. She's admitted in Narayana Health City Hospital (formerly Narayana Hrudayalaya), Hosur road, near Bommasandra, Bangalore. Thank you!

I was living in BSR Mantralaya managed by a company named Furnome, while staying there they got acquired by another company named Grexter, everything was going smoothly, I paid rent at 1st of every month without ever missing. After I left the apartment in September, Grexter informed me that there will be a delay of 2 months which I agreed since their business was affected due to lockdown, later on they said there will be more delay but will give deposit back with interest. When I enquired again after 2 months, they said Grexter no longer owns furnome and Furnome should give back the deposit. I contacted Furnome and they said they have no money and there will be delay. Whenever I contact them, they further move the date they will return deposit. On January 7th, I contacted them and asked them if I can live in building and they can cut rent from deposit to which they agreed, yesterday when I called again to confirm my return dates, they said they returned back the building to original owners 2 months back so I will have to pay rent to owners but liability of Deposit is still with Furnome. I am totally fed up by this situation and know a couple more(could be a lot) people in similar situation. I wanted to know what are my options in this situation?

What started as a low-spec computer for DIY enthusiasts, it can now be used as full-featured desktop. With the Raspberry Pi 400 release, they are making it more friendly for home computer usage. The Raspberry Pi 400 is basically a computer in the form of a keyboard. If you remember, Commodore 64 was also a computer in the form of a keyboard back in 1982. Even though it isn\\u2019t unique, for a successful product like Raspberry Pi, it is a sweet deal. Raspberry Pi 400: Overview It is based on the Raspberry Pi 4 (with 4 GB RAM) and has been tweaked to run cooler as well. With a Quad-core processor, it is faster than ever. Not just limited to the ease of use and portability, but it should save you a lot of desk space. And, just like me, if you were planning to get a spare computer to test stuff, I think I may want to go with the Raspberry Pi 400 instead of building another PC or Linux-based mini PC. Even though I\\u2019ve mentioned the tech specs below, you can watch the official video to get an idea on how it looks and if it\\u2019s promising enough as your home computer: Raspberry Pi 400 specification Here\\u2019s the tech specs for the Pi 400: Broadcom BCM2711 quad-core Cortex-A72 (ARM v8) 64-bit SoC @ 1.8GHz 4GB LPDDR4-3200 Dual-band (2.4GHz and 5.0GHz) IEEE 802.11b\\/g\\/n\\/ac wireless LAN Bluetooth 5.0, BLE Gigabit Ethernet 2 \\u00d7 USB 3.0 and 1 \\u00d7 USB 2.0 ports Horizontal 40-pin GPIO header 2 \\u00d7 micro HDMI ports (supports up to 4Kp60) H.265 (4Kp60 decode); H.264 (1080p60 decode, 1080p30 encode); OpenGL ES 3.0 graphics MicroSD card slot for operating system and data storage 78- or 79-key compact keyboard (depending on regional variant) 5V DC via USB connector Operating temperature: 0\\u00b0C to +50\\u00b0C ambient Maximum dimensions 286 mm \\u00d7 122 mm \\u00d7 23 mm Pricing & Availability For $70, this is the best modern home computer that you can get with the simplicity of just having a keyboard and being able to carry it anywhere (you just need a screen to connect to). You can either get just the Raspberry Pi 400 for $70 or get the complete kit for $100 with a USB mouse, micro HDMI to HDMI cable, USB-C power supply, a beginners guide, and an SD card with Raspberry Pi OS pre-installed. If you\\u2019re wondering, for the keyboard layout support, here\\u2019s what the press release mentioned: At launch, we are supporting English (UK and US), French, Italian, German, and Spanish keyboard layouts, with (for the first time) translated versions of the Beginner\\u2019s Guide. In the near future, we plan to support the same set of languages as our official keyboard. In other words, they support every major keyboard layout to start with. So, it shouldn\\u2019t be an issue for the majority. In addition to the details for keyboard layout, here\\u2019s how you can get your hands on a Raspberry Pi 400: UK, US, and French Raspberry Pi 400 kits and computers are available to buy right now. Italian, German, and Spanish units are on their way to Raspberry Pi Approved Resellers, who should have them in stock in the next week. We expect that Approved Resellers in India, Australia, and New Zealand will have kits and computers in stock by the end of the year. We\\u2019re rapidly rolling out compliance certification for other territories too, so that Raspberry Pi 400 will be available around the world in the first few months of 2021. Of course, if you\\u2019re anywhere near Cambridge, you can head over to the Raspberry Pi Store to pick up your Raspberry Pi 400 today. Raspberry Pi 400 Wrapping Up Raspberry Pi 400 is definitely something impressive and useful in the current time when remote work is becoming the new norm.

The latter are evidently immaterial. 3\\/n This is-- to put it frankly-- absolutely fucking insane and should shock ALL Americans. Can you imagine a state agency rolling up to court and insisting that Christianity and Islam enshrine prejudice against \\\"non-believers\\\"? 4\\/n They'd rightly be laughed out of court and excoriated for their prejudice. More importantly, the average American would recognize this as fundamentally averse to the first amendment and freedom of religion. Why is this not the case when it comes to Hinduism? How is this OK? 5\\/n We recognize that the adherents of the religions themselves are entitled to define their own beliefs. Hindus are not afforded this luxury. Our beliefs-- it seems-- are defined by bureaucrats working for the State of California; 6\\/n the State of California is insisting that your views as a \\\"Hindu\\\" are not your own, but rather wholly dependent on the judgment of a court, whose judges apparently have the authority to tell you what YOU believe. Again, this is insanity. 7\\/n This issue is distinct from the question of whether the alleged discrimination in this case was motivated by caste prejudice, and whether caste (jati)-- which is a pan-subcontinental social reality--is cognizable under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. 8\\/n There is a genuine discussion to be had about this question and as Hindu Americans we need to be at the forefront of the fight against casteism, but all Americans should recoil at the prejudicial and unconstitutional, assertions made by the State of CA in this filing. \\/end Source Basically being a Hindu in America will attract hatred on par as being a N'zi supporter [link] [comments]\",\"2879\":\"Comments\",\"2958\":\"My friend left 2 cats in a pet boarding in electronic city. Both are only 8-9 months old now. one male (neutered) other female (not yet neutered) Today we were informed that the cat is 3 weeks pregnant. My friend is already paying 12k per month for both of them (food extra) Now the caretaker lady is asking for all the expenses that will be involved (castration, abortion, transportations to vet) otherwise she'll not take care of it. I feel that it's her responsibility to take care and should've kept her separate from not neutered male cats which were left at her place. It's not like she's providing a free service, she's charging good amount for it. So much expenses now she's asking for us to bear. imo it's her fault, and because of it little cat has to go through all this stress that she's not ready for, she's just 8 months old, and on top of that she's asking us to pay all the expenses, else she'll not get her operated. I'm looking for suggestions on what we can do in this situation as both of us are outside Bangalore right now. My friend can go back to bangalore in February.

Immediately a customer rep called my mom. I asked her about the speed and she assured me we would get 40mbps upload and download speed. She asked my mom to send the KYC documents over WhatsApp. This was a personal whatsapp number, not an airtel company whatsapp. My mom sent her documents and details. We got an OTP from Airtel which the customer representative again insisted we should tell it to her over call. She said thats how it works. So we gave her the OTP. Then we received a payment link from Airtel and paid the activation amount of Rs.1758 (the payment was authentic). Another rep called and said the installation guy was on his way. Then the installation guy calls and tells us that he has been instructed to provide 2mbps speed to us!! If we wanted 2mbps why would we even go for broadband?? Our phone data can provide that!! Everything we did and filled was for the specific Airtel plan of 40mbps. I know you may say its \\\"upto 40\\\" but how can it be as low as 2mbps?? That too when I double checked with the customer service person over the phone?? Now we try to contact every representative that had been calling us all along until the payment and no reply from a single one of them! They keep cutting the call the second it rings! We have emailed a complaint to Airtel. Is there anything else we can do? Is there any consumer court that can resolve this issue hassle free?

For instance, youtube-dl project was taken down by Microsoft to comply with a DMCA request. With a centralized approach, you do not have a lot of control and privacy. Of course, this may not be a big deal for many folks but if you are someone who does not want centralized servers, want to have peer-to-peer code collaboration feature, and something that works offline, Radicle will be a good tool for them. Radicle: A Peer-to-Peer Code Collaboration Platform Radicle is an open-source project that aims to provide a decentralized app for code collaboration. You can connect peer-to-peer if you need to share the project and work along with someone else. It is still something in beta but it is definitely worth looking at. I did some quick tests without our team to see if the basic features to share the project works or not. But, before you try it out, let me highlight the important features that you get with Radicle and what you can expect from it in the near future. Features of Radicle Ability to add multiple remote peers Manage multiple peers Feature to follow a project from a specific peer Share your project using a unique ID Does not depend on central servers No censorship One network interconnected with peers Ability to work offline Local issues & patches Built on Git to make it easy and comfortable for most developers Your infrastructure Ability to receive funding from your supporters (Ethereum) Manage codebases together Expect more features for bug reporting and code review in the near future considering that it is still in early development. Recommended Read: Meet LBRY, A Blockchain-based Decentralized Alternative to YouTube LBRY is a new Blockchain-based, open source platform for sharing digital content. It is gaining popularity as a decentralized alternative to YouTube but LBRY is more than just a video sharing service. Installing Radicle on Linux It provides an AppImage for Linux distributions. So, no matter whether you have an Ubuntu-based system or an Arch system, you can easily use it on your Linux system. In case you do not know, please refer to our guide on using AppImage in Linux to get started quickly. Download Radicle Thoughts on Using Radicle If you are familiar with Git version control system, using this should be a breeze. I just did some basic testing where I created a test repository and shared it with my teammate. It works quite well. But, you need to configure Git with your name and email address before you get started. Of course, you will need the terminal to configure and use the git version control, but the GUI is easy to use and understand. It is easy to manage remotes, copy the unique ID to share the project, and you can explore more when you try to use it for your projects. I\\u2019d advise you to experiment with it and go through the documentation, official site, along with their GitHub page before trying it out for an important project. What do you think about Radicle? Even though it is in BETA phase, do you think it will gain traction and be something popular among the open-source developers?

It is an open source fork of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and provides the goodness of RHEL without the cost associated with RHEL. However, things have changed recently. Red Hat is converting a stable CentOS to a rolling release model in the form of CentOS Stream. CentOS 8 was supposed to be supported till 2029 but it is now forced discontinued by the end of 2021. If you are using CentOS for your servers, it may make you wonder where to go from here. See, the first and foremost choice for replacing CentOS 8 is CentOS Stream. The process to upgrade CentOS 8 to CentOS Stream is simple and you don\\u2019t have to worry about reinstalling anything here. However, since CentOS Stream is of rolling release nature, you may want to consider something that is more stable for a production server. I\\u2019ll help you with that decision by suggestion some recommendations in this article. RHEL-based server Linux distributions you may want to consider for replacing CentOS I\\u2019ll start the list with some of the RHEL forks that are being developed with the sole purpose of replacing CentOS 8. After that, I\\u2019ll list the server distributions that you may use right away. Rocky Linux (under development) The same day Red Hat announced its plans to replace stable CentOS 8 with rolling release CentOS Stream, the original developer of CentOS announced a new project to provide RHEL fork to CentOS users. This new project is called Rocky Linux. It is named in the memory of one of the co-creators of the original CentOS project. It\\u2019s been forked from RHEL 8 and aims to be \\u201c100% bug-for-bug compatible with Red Hat Enterprise Linux\\u201d. The project is under rapid development and may not be usable at the moment. But this is one of the top choices to replace CentOS 8 when the support ends by the end of 2021. Project Lenix (under development) This is another RHEL fork created on a day after the announcement of CentOS Stream becoming the default. Project Lenix is being created by CloudLinux, an enterprise oriented service that has been providing customized CentOS server for several years now. Cosnidering their years of experience with CentOS and enterprise servers, Project Lenix should be a promising RHEL fork to replace CentOS Stream. Oracle Linux Probably the only RHEL fork in this list that is read to use in the best possible manner. Not only ready to use, you can even migrate from existing CentOS install to Oracle Linux without reinstalling it. Oracle Linux has been available since 2006. It is 100% application binary compatible with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and it provides an equivalent to each RHEL release. And no, you don\\u2019t need to sign any agreement with Oracle for using Oracle Linux. Oracle Linux comes with two choices of Linux kernels: the Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel (UEK) for Oracle Linux or the Red Hat Compatible Kernel (RHCK). It\\u2019s just that track record of Oracle is not very good with open source projects and probably this is the reason why a true community fork in the form of CentOS was preferred over Oracle Linux. With CentOS being replaced with CentOS Stream, perhaps it is the right time to give Oracle a chance? ClearOS (from HP) ClearOS is offered by HP on its HPE ProLiant servers. Though it is not clearly mentioned on their website, ClearOS is based on RHEL and CentOS. Clear Center and HPE have partnered on this project. The open source ClearOS available for free to the community. They have their own app marketplace with a mix of free and paid applications. You don\\u2019t pay for the OS but you may have to pay for the apps, if you opt for a paid one. It might not be that popular but with CentOS Stream becoming default, ClearOS stands to gain some user base, if HP plays its cards right. Will they do it? I am not so sure. Oracle is trying to lure CentOS users but I have seen no such efforts from HP. Springdale Linux (academic project from Princeton University) A Red Hat fork maintained by academicians? That\\u2019s Scientific Linux, right? But Scientific Linux has been dead for over a year. Springdale Linux (SDL) is another such project by Princeton University. It was previously known as PUIAS (Princeton University Institute for Advanced Study). There is no RHEL 8 equivalent of Springdale Linux yet which gives some hint about the speed of development here. Server distributions that are not based on Red Hat Alright! So far, the list mentions the distributions based on Red Hat. It\\u2019s time to look at some of the server distributions that have nothing to do with RHEL but the are still a good choice for your production server. YunoHost (Specially customized for web servers) YunoHost is based on Debian and customized for the purpose of provide you a system for hosting your web servers. You can use it on ARM boards like Raspberry Pi, old desktops and computers of course on virtual private servers. YunoHost also provides a web-based admin interface (inspired by Webmin?) so that you can manage the system graphically. This is a great relief for someone who wants to host a web server but without getting too much into the command line stuff. Debian Linux The universal operating system provides a rock-solid server distribution. An ideal choice for those who want a stable system. If you had invested too much time and skill in CentOS, you may find Debian slightly different, specially the package management system. Though, I believe, it should not be much of a trouble for a seasoned Linux sysadmin. openSUSE SUSE is one of the direct competitors of Red Hat. They have the enterprise offering in the form of SUSE Linux Enterprise. Their open source offering openSUSE is also quite popular, both as desktop and server. openSUSE makes up a good choice for a server Linux distribution. People these days won\\u2019t understand what a relief YAST tool of SUSE brought for users in the last 90s and early 2000s. It is still a handy utility for managing the SUSE system. openSUSE comes in two formats: the rolling release Tumbleweed and the stable point release Leap. I am guessing you are looking for stability so Leap is what you should be aiming for. Ubuntu Ubuntu Ubuntu is the most popular distribution in the world, both on servers and desktops. This is the reason why this list could not have been completed without Ubuntu. Since I have been using Ubuntu for a long time, I feel comfortable hosting my web servers on Ubuntu. But that\\u2019s just me. If you are coming from the RHEL domain, package management is different here along with a few networking and management components. Ubuntu LTS version come with five years of support which is half of what a CentOS release provided. You may opt for a paid extended support for an outdated LTS version if you don\\u2019t want to upgrade versions. What\\u2019s your choice? I have listed some of the top recommendations for RHEL based distributions as well as for generic server distributions. Now it\\u2019s your turn. Which of the above listed distributions you liked the most? Do you have any other suggestions to add to this list?

And this surprises me. Because for me, it is one of the features that I simply love to use on Linux desktop. If you are not aware of it already, (almost) all applications have this \\u201cAlways on Top\\u201d option. Usually, when you open a new application, it gets the focus and occupies the screen above all other running applications. With the \\u201cAlways on Top\\u201d option selected, the application window will always be visible, no matter what other application you open. This comes handy for me in situations where I have to use terminal and read something together. I can keep the terminal in \\u201cAlways on Top\\u201d mode so that it remains visible while I browse the internet or interact with team members through Rocket Chat. Using \\u201cAlways on Top\\u201d feature in Linux This cannot be simpler than this. All you have to do is to right-click on the top bar of the application. In here, select the Always on Top option. That\\u2019s it. Right click on the application bar and select the option Keep in mind that the position of the application is not fixed. You can move the application to any corner of the screen. It will remain visible on the top of all opened applications. To disable the \\u201cAlways on Top\\u201d mode, you have to select it one more time. Same steps: Right click on the application bar and select the Always on Top option Do note that you won\\u2019t see the \\u201cAlways on Top\\u201d option if your application is in full-window mode. I know switching between applications is a matter of Alt+Tab keys but when you have several applications running, switching apps will require more than two keystrokes. This feature should be available in most desktop environments. If you don\\u2019t see it, please check which desktop environment you are using and let me know. I\\u2019ll update the article with the information.

It also shows you how to remove those RPM packages afterwards. When you start using Fedora Linux in the Red Hat domain, sooner or later, you\\u2019ll come across .rpm files. Like .exe files in Windows and .deb files in Ubuntu and Debian, .rpm files enable you to quickly install a software from it on Fedora. You could find and install plenty of software from the software center, specially if you enable additional repositories in Fedora. But sometimes you\\u2019ll find software available on their website in RPM format. Like .exe files in Windows, you download the .rpm file and double click on it to install it. Don\\u2019t worry, I\\u2019ll show you the detailed steps. Installing RPM files on Fedora and Red Hat Linux I\\u2019ll be showing you three ways to install RPM files: Install RPM files with software center (GUI method) Install RPM files using DNF command (CLI method) Install RPM files using Yum command (CLI method for Red Hat) Method 1: Use software center The simplest method is to use the default software center in Fedora. It\\u2019s really simple. Go to the folder where you downloaded the .rpm file. It is usually the Downloads folder. Just double click on the RPM file and it will be opened in the software center. Alternatively, you can right click on the file and choose to install it via Software Center. Either double click or right click and choose Software Install When it is opened in the software center, you should see the installation option. Just hit the install button and enter your account\\u2019s password when prompted for it. Install RPM via Fedora Software Center It\\u2019s easy, right? Method 2: Use DNF command to install RPM file This is the command line method. Fedora uses the new DNF package manager and you can use it to install downloaded RPM files as well. Open a terminal and switch to the directory where you have the RPM file downloaded. You can also provide the path to the RPM file. Use the DNF command like this: sudo dnf install rpm_file_name Here\\u2019s a screenshot where I installed Google Chrome on Fedora with dnf command: Installing RPM files using DNF command Method 3: Install RPM files in Red Hat using Yum command Unlike Fedora, Red Hat still uses the good old Yum package manager. You won\\u2019t find the DNF command here, yet. The process is the same as DNF command. You go to the directory where the RPM file is located or provide its path. sudo yum install path_to_RPM_file That\\u2019s it. Nothing fancier. How to remove RPM packages Removing a RPM package isn\\u2019t a big deal either. And no, you don\\u2019t need the original rpm file that you used to install the program. You may find the installed package in the software center and remove application from there. Removing RPM Package Alternatively, you can use the DNF or YUM command with remove option. With DNF, use this command: sudo dnf remove rpm_package_name With Yum, use this command: sudo yum remove rpm_package_name You probably won\\u2019t remember the exact package name and that\\u2019s fine. What you can do is to type the first few letters of the package and then hit tab. This is assuming that you have tab completion enabled which usually is. And that\\u2019s all you need to do here. Pretty simple, right? Being a beginner, you may struggle with a simple task like this and I hope you feel more confident with Fedora thanks to quick tutorials like this.\",\"5403\":\"So, I recently got a job offer from zycus.

A neighbor who is 68, in my apartment complex was admitted in MSRMH for weakness and breathing difficulties. It wasn't covid but TB type of illness for which he got treated and discharged. His insurance covered 90% of the costs apparently. There was a follow up check up after 10 days, and I agreed to take him because his kids aren't in town. In the follow up, the doctors told everything is fine, but since he is a senior citizen who is still sort of weak, asked prescribed to take xray of lungs, covid test and if that's negative then anti sars covid igg test just to see antibodies and show him the results the next day. In the next 20 mins, I was called atleast 3 times by some hospital staff if I had taken the tests. The xray was rs320, covid test was rs4200 and anti sars igg test was rs.3650 in MSRMH. Consultation fee was already rs. 700\\/-.The old man isn't that rich and he was worrying, so I got the xray done at the hospital itself, got the covid test for free at bbmp center and igg test from apollo diagnostic at rs.500\\/-. I had informed the hospital staff I got the tests done. The next day though, the doctor was kinda shocked to see reports which were not from the hospital. I told him cost is too high here so I got it done outside, he was kinda mumbling that the hospital tests are more accurate and you can't depend on other centres, but gave the consultation. The hospital staff were more shocked when they found out later, they told me you can't bring outside reports like this and why I did it without informing them as they had already informed the dept that I will come. The same doctor was passing by and he gave a death stare to the staff, and they just pretended to be busy and left us alone. I already know Cloudnine has sales target for support staff on room bookings and extra services. Was wondering if other hospitals do this too. Seems to be unethical right? I never want to second guess an expert opinion on tests etc but these kinda experiences sometimes does shake that belief. And your OPD tests and consulting doesn't get covered in insurance either.

It is indeed very easy and consists of three simple steps. Step 1: You write your program and save the file with a .c extension. For example, my_program.c. Step 2: You compile the program and generate the object file using gcc compiler in a terminal like this: gcc -o my_program my_program.c Step 3: You run the generated object file to run your C program in Linux: .\\/my_program This was just the quick summary on how to compile and run C program in Linux. If you are new to either C or Linux, I\\u2019ll show these steps in detail so that you feel comfortable coding C program in Linux environment. In fact, I\\u2019ll discuss how to run C programs in Linux terminal as well as in code editor. Method 1: How to run C programs in Linux terminal In order to run a C program in Linux, you need to have a C compiler present on your systems. The most popular compiler is gcc (GNU Compiler Collection). You can install gcc using your distribution\\u2019s package manager. In Debian and Ubuntu-based Linux distributions, use the apt command: sudo apt install gcc Switch to directory where you have kept your C program (or provide the path) and then generate the object file by compiling the program: gcc -o my_program my_program.c Keep in mind that it is optional to provide the output object file (-o my_program). If you won\\u2019t do that, an object file named a.out will be automatically generated. But this is not good because it will be overwritten for each C program and you won\\u2019t be able to know which program the a.out object file belongs to. Once you have your object file generated, run it to run the C program. It is already executable. Simple use it like this: .\\/my_program And it will display the desired output, if your program is correct. As you can see, this is not very different from running C++ programs in Linux. Every time you make a change in your program, you have to compile it first and then run the generated object file to run the C program. Method 2: How to run C programs in Linux using a code editor like Visual Studio Code Not everyone is comfortable with command line and terminal and I totally understand that. You can use a proper C\\/C++ IDE like Eclipse or Code Blocks but they are often too heavy programs and more suitable for large projects. I recommend using an open source code editor like Visual Studio Code or Atom. These are basically text editors and you can install add-ons to compile and run programs directly from the graphical code editor. I am using Visual Studio Code editor in this example. It\\u2019s a hugely popular open source code editor from Microsoft. First thing first, install Visual Studio Code in Ubuntu from the software center. For other distributions, please check your Linux distribution\\u2019s package manager or software center. You may also check the official website for more information. Start Visual Studio Code and open\\/create a project and create your C program here. I am using a sample Hello World program. You must ensure that you have gcc compiler installed on your Linux system. sudo apt install gcc Next thing you would want is to use an extension that allows you to run the C code. Microsoft may prompt you for installing its own extension for C\\/C++ program but it is complicated to setup and hence I won\\u2019t recommend it. Instead, I suggest using the Code Runner extension. It\\u2019s a no-nonsense extension and you can run C and C++ code easily without additional configuration. Go to the Extensions tab and search for \\u2018Code Runner\\u2019 and install it. Install Code Runner extension for running C\\/C++ program Restart Visual Studio Code. Now, you should be able to run the C code by using one of the following way: Using the shortcut Ctrl+Alt+N. Press F1 and then select or type Run Code. Right click the text editor and the click Run code from context menu. Right click the program file and choose Run Code When you run the program, it is compiled automatically and then run. You can see the output in terminal that is opened at the bottom of the editor. What could be better than this? Program output is displayed in the bottom section of the editor Which method do you prefer? Running a few C programs in Linux command line is okay but using a code editor is much easier and saves time. Won\\u2019t you agree? I let you decide whichever method you want to use.\",\"388\":\"Comments\",\"3624\":\"Samachar @10 am | Centre, Farmers to hold 10th round of talks today and other top stories\",\"5023\":\"Went to Netaji Bhawan in Kolkata to pay tributes to the brave Subhas Bose.

Fret not, it isn\\u2019t rocket science to tweak the task switcher in KDE. In this article, I\\u2019m going to show you how to change the task switcher experience on any KDE-powered Linux system. Customize Task Switcher in KDE: Here\\u2019s How It is Done If you prefer video instructions I have also made a quick video for you: Here are the text instructions: Kde Task Switcher Default Style To get started, you need to head to the System Settings in KDE as shown in the screenshot below. Next, you have to navigate your way to the \\u201cWindow Management\\u201d option as shown in the image below. Once you click on the option, you will be greeted with more options. Here, you need to click on \\u201cTask Switcher\\u201d because that is what we are going to customize, you can explore other options if you are curious. As you can observe in the screenshot above, my settings may look different that yours: I have disabled the option to \\u201cShow selected window\\u201c And, have set the visual style of the task switcher to \\u201cFlip Switch\\u201c Here\\u2019s how it looks like with the Flip Switch style when you press Alt+Tab: In case you cannot find the option to set it, take a closer look at how you navigate the drop-down menu to change the visual style of Task Switcher while potentially disabling \\u201cShow selected Window\\u201d (that\\u2019s what I prefer). As you can see in the image above, you get to change the sort order of the windows along with a couple more visual styles for the task switcher. In addition to this setting, you can also look for a variety of task switcher themes\\/designs online by click on \\u201cGet New Task Switchers\\u201d button in the bottom-right corner of the window. You will also find several other options to change the key bind for accessing the tasks switcher, if that is what you need. Reset to default in a click If you want to revert the settings and want it to go back to the defaults. You will find a \\u201cDefaults\\u201d \\/ \\u201cReset\\u201d button, you can click on it to reset any changes that you made. Of course, feel free to explore any other customization options that you come across in the System Settings to personalize your KDE experience.

Considering the complexities of managing personal finances and business transactions, you will find a lot of online services or software tools that aim to simplify things. Some tools simply let you add expenses and income to keep track of your savings while others offer different features. I have already covered several open source account software in the past. Here, I will be focusing on one of the options \\u2014 GnuCash, which is a popular free accounting software with plenty of features for every user. GnuCash: Free & Open Source Accounting Software GnuCash is a free accounting software tailored for professional requirements to track transactions, stocks, etc. It is available for Linux, BSD, macOS, and Windows as well.

You can get a detailed report to analyze after you\\u2019ve started managing an account and added transactions to it. Features of GnuCash As I mentioned earlier, GnuCash comes loaded with a bunch of features which could be overwhelming for someone new to accounting, but I think it should be worth it: Double-entry Accounting Stock\\/Bond\\/Mutual Fund accounts Small-business accounting with tax support (like GST in India) Detailed report for breakdown Graph for easy analysis Financial calculations support Auto-saving feature Color coding Online Banking Wizard Journal Loan repayment calculator Price database for quick calculation Budget balance sheet, flow, graph for each category Ability to export as CSV Add Customer, Vendor, and Employee records separately Scheduled transactions Ability to set a Budget Configuring bill generator to ease up the accounting process I\\u2019m no expert but this is just the tip of the iceberg. You will find a host of options to customize and set for your accounting needs. Gnucash Report Installing GnuCash on Linux You can find GnuCash in the software center of your Linux distribution. Install it from there or use the package manager of your distribution. A Flatpak package is also available for those who want the latest version.

Alternatively, you can build it from source or you can head to their official download page to explore options for your Linux distribution. GnuCash Wrapping Up For basic personal finance management, it was a little overwhelming for me because I prefer to use an Android app for simplicity. However, if you take a look around for a few minutes, it is easy to understand and GnuCash seems flexible for most requirements. If you like to manage your or your business\\u2019s finances, you may give it a try.

It is a lightweight program with a bunch of essential options to edit images quickly. Here\\u2019s an overview of LazPaint. LazPaint: Open Source Paint.NET Alternative for Linux If you are fond of using tools to quickly edit and manipulate images and screenshots, you may have heard about Paint.NET, which is available only for Windows systems. It is a popular nifty tool to get a lot of basic editing tasks done along with a bunch of options available. You might be aware of several image editing tools but Paint.NET is a pretty popular option just because it is easy to use without any bloated feature for an average user. LazPaint comes to the rescue as an impressive open source replacement to Paint.NET for Linux, Windows, and macOS. It offers most of the essential features one would need to manipulate images while being easy to use. Since it is cross-platform application, even if you\\u2019re not using a Linux system, you could still start using it as a no-nonsense free and open-source tool, if that\\u2019s your priority. Now, let us take a look at some features it offers. Features of LazPaint As I mentioned earlier, LazPaint offers a bunch of essential features. Here, I\\u2019ll list the key highlights that can help you decide if you need it. However, I\\u2019d recommend you to explore it to know more about it. All major file formats supported (including layered Bitmaps and 3D files) Selection Tools, Crop to Selection, Selection Pen, Invert Selection Export to Krita supported Image resampling with various quality settings Motion Blur, Custom Blur, Radial Blur, and Pixelate tool Ability to remove transparency and flatten the image Rotate and Flip images Convert images to Negatives Ability to re-size Canvas Deforming tool (perspective) Advanced Drawing tools Set workspace color Dark theme Supports script functionality Layer support with essential management options Layer effects Filters Grayscale effect Ability to enable\\/disable the toolbar in or attach them to the Dock Recommended Read: Drawing is an Open Source MS-Paint Type of App for Linux Desktop Installing LazPaint on Linux You should find it available in your official repositories to install it via your default package manager but to get the latest version, you will have to download the .deb file or compile it from source on non-Debian based Distributions. I wish there was a Flatpak available to get the latest version on every Linux distribution \\u2014 but nothing as of now. It is available for Windows and macOS as well. You will also find a portable version available for Windows, that could come in handy. LazPaint Closing Thoughts on LazPaint I found it really easy to use and the variety of quality settings to re-sample (or resize) an image is definitely a good addition. If you\\u2019ve already installed it, you must have noticed that it does not take a significant amount of storage to get installed and is a lightweight program overall. It\\u2019s snappy, and most of the functions that I tested in my quick usage worked quite well without any issues. What do you think about LazPaint as a Paint.NET alternative?

No matter what you do, improving productivity is a common goal for most of the people. Usually, you would end up trying various to-do list apps or a note-taking app to help yourself organize and remind things to efficiently keep up with your work. Sure, you can check out those lists and try them as you like. Here, I\\u2019ve come across something unique that you also may want to try if you wanted a desktop to-do application with a solid user interface, GitHub\\/GitLab integration, and a list of essential features. Super Productivity seems to be an impressive to-do list app with some unique features to offer. In this article, I\\u2019ll let you know all about it briefly. Super Productivity: A Simple & Attractive Open-Source To-do App Super Productivity is an open-source app, and it is actively maintained by Johannes Millan on GitHub. To me, the user experience matters the most, and I\\u2019m completely impressed with the UI offered by Super Productivity. It also offers a bunch of essential features along with some interesting options. Let\\u2019s take a look at them. Features of Super Productivity Add to-do tasks, description Track time spent on tasks and break Project management (with JIRA, GitHub, and GitLab integration) Ability to schedule tasks Language selection option Sync option to Dropbox, Google Drive, or any other WebDAV storage location Import\\/Export functionality Auto-backup functionality Ability to tweak the behavior of timers and counters Dark Mode theme available Add attachment to tasks Ability to repeat tasks completely for free Cross-platform support In addition to the features I mentioned, you will find more detailed settings and tweaks to configure. Especially, the integration with JIRA, GitHub and GitLab. You can automatically assign tasks to work on without needing to check your email for the recent updates to issue trackers or tickets. Compared to many premium to-do web services that I\\u2019ve used so far, you will be surprised to find many useful features completely for free. You can also take a look at the video below to get some idea: Installing Super Productivity on Linux You get a variety of options to install. I downloaded the AppImage file to test. But, you can also get the deb package for Debian-based distros. It is also available as a snap. You can find all the packages in the GitHub releases section. If you\\u2019re curious, you can check out its GitHub page to know more about it. Download Super Productivity Concluding Thoughts I found the user experience fantastic with Super Productivity. The features offered are incredibly useful and considering that you get some premium functionalities (that you\\u2019d get normally with to-do web services) it could be a perfect replacement for most of the users. You can simply sync the data using Google Drive, Dropbox, or any other WebDAV storage location. It could also replace a service like ActivityWatch to help you track the time you work on your tasks and remain idle. So, it could be your all-in-one solution for improving productivity!

This chapter of Linux Jargon Buster briefly explains these terms so that you, as a (new) Linux user, can understand the context better when these acronyms are used. To be honest, the terms GUI, CLI and TUI are not exclusive to Linux. These are generic computing terms that you\\u2019ll find used in non-Linux discussions, as well. GUI \\u2013 Graphical User Interface \\u201cGUI\\u201d is probably the most common term you\\u2019ll come across on It\\u2019s FOSS because we focus on desktop Linux users and try to cover the easy-to-use graphical methods and applications. A GUI application or graphical application is basically anything that you can interact with using your mouse, touchpad or touch screen. You have icons and other visual prompts that you can activate with your mouse pointer to access the functionalities. GIMP: A GUI app for photo editing In a Linux distribution, a desktop environment provides the graphical interface for you to interact with your system. Then you can use GUI applications such as GIMP, VLC, Firefox, LibreOffice, and file manager for various tasks. GUI has made computing easier for the average user. CLI \\u2013 Command Line Interface CLI is basically a command line program that accepts inputs to perform a certain function. Any application that you can use via commands in the terminal falls into this category. apt-cache is a CLI tool for interacting with APT cache on Debian-based systems Early computers didn\\u2019t have mouse to interact with the operating system, only keyboards. If you think that\\u2019s difficult you should know that the earlier computers didn\\u2019t even have a screen to see what was being typed; they had actual paper printers to display the typed commands. I have never used such a computer, or even seen one. The closest thing I used were the microcontroller kits during my studies. Ken Thompson And Dennis Ritchie Working on developing UNIX operating system on PDP 11 computer. | Image Credit Is CLI relevant these days? Absolutely. Commands always have benefits, especially when you are dealing with the core functioning and configuration of the operating system, such as setting up a firewall, managing a network or package management. You may have a GUI-based application to do the same task, but commands give you more granular access to those features. In any case, you\\u2019ll find that GUI applications also interact with the operating system with commands (used in their code). Handbrake GUI app uses FFMPEG CLI tool underneath Many popular GUI applications are often based on CLI tools. Consider Handbrake for example. It\\u2019s a popular open source media converter that uses the FFMPEG command line tool underneath. Quite evidently, using command line tools is not as easy as the graphical ones. Don\\u2019t worry. Unless you have specific needs, you should be able to use your Linux system graphically. However, knowing the basic Linux commands helps a great deal. TUI \\u2013 Terminal User Interface TUI is also known as Text-based User Interface. This is the most uncommon term of the three. TUI is basically part GUI and part CLI. Confused? Let me explain it for you. You already know that early computers used CLI. Before the advent of GUI, the text-based user interface provided a very basic kind of graphical interaction in the terminal. You have more visuals and could use mouse and keyboard to interact with the application. nnn File Browser in terminal TUI stands for text-based user interface or terminal user interface. Text-based because primarily, you have a bunch of text on the screen and terminal user interface because they are used only in the terminal. TUI applications are not well-known to many users, but there are a bunch of them. Terminal based web browsers are good example of TUI programs. Terminal-based games also fall into this category. CMUS is terminal based music player You may come across TUI when you are installing multimedia codecs in Ubuntu where you have to accept EULA or make a choice. TUI apps are not as user-friendly as GUI applications, and they often have a learning curve involved but they are a bit easier to use than the command line tools. In the end \\u2026 TUI apps are often also considered as CLI applications because they are restricted to the terminal. In my opinion, it\\u2019s up to you if you consider them different from CLI. I hope you liked this part of Linux Jargon Buster.

You can go to the extent of making it act as a tiling window manager. KDE Plasma can confuse a beginner by the degree of customization it offers. As options tend to pile on top of options, the user starts getting lost. To address that issue, I\\u2019ll show you the key points of KDE Plasma customization that you should be aware of. This is some Customizing KDE Plasma I have used KDE Neon in this tutorial, but you may follow it with any distribution that uses KDE Plasma desktop. 1. Plasma Widgets Desktop widgets can add convenience to the user experience, as you can immediately access important items on the desktop. Students and professionals nowadays are working with computers more than ever before, a useful widget can be sticky notes. Right-click on the desktop and select \\u201cAdd Widgets\\u201d. Choose the widget you like, and simply drag and drop it to the desktop. 2. Desktop wallpaper This one is too obvious. Changing the wallpaper to change the looks of your desktop. At the wallpaper tab you can change more than just the wallpaper. From the \\u201cLayout\\u201d pulldown menu, you can select if your desktop will have icons or not. The \\u201cFolder View\\u201d layout is named from the traditional desktop folder in your home directory, where you can access your desktop files. Thus, the \\u201cFolder View\\u201d option will retain the icons on the desktop. If you select the \\u201cDesktop\\u201d layout, it will leave your desktop icon free and plain. However, you will still be able to access the desktop folder at the home directory. In Wallpaper Type, you can select if you want a wallpaper or not, to be still or to change and finally in Positioning, how it looks on your screen. 3. Mouse Actions Each mouse button can be configured to one of the following actions: Switch Desktop Paste Switch Window Standard Menu Application Launcher Switch Activity The right-click is set to Standard Menu, which is the menu when you right-click on the desktop. The contents of the menu can be changed by clicking on the settings icon next to it. 4. Location of your desktop content This option is only available if you select the \\u201cFolder View\\u201d in the wallpaper tab. By default, the content shown on your desktop is what you have at the desktop folder at the home directory. The location tab gives you the option to change the content on your desktop, by selecting a different folder. 5. Desktop Icons Here you can select how the icons will be arranged (horizontally or vertically), right or left, the sorting criteria and their size. If this is not enough, you have additional aesthetic features to explore. 6. Desktop Filters Let\\u2019s be honest with ourselves! I believe every user ends up with a cluttered desktop at some point. If your desktop becomes messy and can\\u2019t find a file, you can apply a filter either by name or type and find what you need. Although, it\\u2019s better to make a good file housekeeping a habit! 7. Application Dashboard If you like the GNOME 3 application launcher, you may try the KDE application dashboard. All you have to do is to right click on the menu icon div class=\\\"wp-block-image\\\"figure class=\\\"aligncenter size-full\\\"img data-attachment-id=\\\"86855\\\" data-permalink=\\\"https:\\/\\/itsfoss.com\\/kde-customization\\/5-kde-neon-show-alternatives\\/\\\" data-orig-file=\\\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/itsfoss.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2021\\/01\\/5-kde-neon-show-alternatives.png?fit=800%2C500&ssl=1\\\" data-orig-size=\\\"800,500\\\" data-comments-opened=\\\"1\\\" data-image-meta=\\\"{\\\"aperture\\\":\\\"0\\\",\\\"credit\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"camera\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"caption\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"created_timestamp\\\":\\\"0\\\",\\\"copyright\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"focal_length\\\":\\\"0\\\",\\\"iso\\\":\\\"0\\\",\\\"shutter_speed\\\":\\\"0\\\",\\\"title\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"orientation\\\":\\\"0\\\"}\\\" data-image-title=\\\"5-kde-neon-show-alternatives\\\" data-image-description=\\\"\\\" data-medium-file=\\\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/itsfoss.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2021\\/01\\/5-kde-neon-show-alternatives.png?fit=300%2C188&ssl=1\\\" data-large-file=\\\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/itsfoss.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2021\\/01\\/5-kde-neon-show-alternatives.png?fit=800%2C500&ssl=1\\\" loading=\\\"lazy\\\" width=\\\"800\\\" height=\\\"500\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/itsfoss.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2021\\/01\\/5-kde-neon-show-alternatives.png?resize=800%2C500&ssl=1\\\" alt=\\\"5 Kde Neon Show Alternatives\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-86855\\\" srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/itsfoss.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2021\\/01\\/5-kde-neon-show-alternatives.png?w=800&ssl=1 800w, https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/itsfoss.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2021\\/01\\/5-kde-neon-show-alternatives.png?resize=300%2C188&ssl=1 300w, https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/itsfoss.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2021\\/01\\/5-kde-neon-show-alternatives.png?resize=768%2C480&ssl=1 768w, https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/itsfoss.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2021\\/01\\/5-kde-neon-show-alternatives.png?resize=100%2C63&ssl=1 100w, https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/itsfoss.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2021\\/01\\/5-kde-neon-show-alternatives.png?resize=150%2C94&ssl=1 150w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\\\" data-recalc-dims=\\\"1\\\" \\/\\/figurediv class=\\\"wp-block-image\\\"figure class=\\\"aligncenter size-full\\\"img data-attachment-id=\\\"86856\\\" data-permalink=\\\"https:\\/\\/itsfoss.com\\/kde-customization\\/6-kde-neon-application-dashboard\\/\\\" data-orig-file=\\\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/itsfoss.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2021\\/01\\/6-kde-neon-application-dashboard.png?fit=800%2C450&ssl=1\\\" data-orig-size=\\\"800,450\\\" data-comments-opened=\\\"1\\\" data-image-meta=\\\"{\\\"aperture\\\":\\\"0\\\",\\\"credit\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"camera\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"caption\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"created_timestamp\\\":\\\"0\\\",\\\"copyright\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"focal_length\\\":\\\"0\\\",\\\"iso\\\":\\\"0\\\",\\\"shutter_speed\\\":\\\"0\\\",\\\"title\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"orientation\\\":\\\"0\\\"}\\\" data-image-title=\\\"6-kde-neon-application-dashboard\\\" data-image-description=\\\"\\\" data-medium-file=\\\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/itsfoss.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2021\\/01\\/6-kde-neon-application-dashboard.png?fit=300%2C169&ssl=1\\\" data-large-file=\\\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/itsfoss.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2021\\/01\\/6-kde-neon-application-dashboard.png?fit=800%2C450&ssl=1\\\" loading=\\\"lazy\\\" width=\\\"800\\\" height=\\\"450\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/itsfoss.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2021\\/01\\/6-kde-neon-application-dashboard.png?resize=800%2C450&ssl=1\\\" alt=\\\"Kde Neon Application Dashboard\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-86856\\\" srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/itsfoss.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2021\\/01\\/6-kde-neon-application-dashboard.png?w=800&ssl=1 800w, https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/itsfoss.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2021\\/01\\/6-kde-neon-application-dashboard.png?resize=300%2C169&ssl=1 300w, https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/itsfoss.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2021\\/01\\/6-kde-neon-application-dashboard.png?resize=768%2C432&ssl=1 768w, https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/itsfoss.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2021\\/01\\/6-kde-neon-application-dashboard.png?resize=100%2C56&ssl=1 100w, https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/itsfoss.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2021\\/01\\/6-kde-neon-application-dashboard.png?resize=150%2C84&ssl=1 150w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\\\" data-recalc-dims=\\\"1\\\" \\/\\/figureh3\\/h3a rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/itsfoss.com\\/customize-xfce\\/\\\" data-type=\\\"post\\\" data-id=\\\"29530\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\/aa href=\\\"https:\\/\\/itsfoss.com\\/mx-linux-kde-edition\\/\\\"\\/a\",\"1070\":\"A South Korean court has sentenced him two and a half years of imprisonment.

This dock (also known as launcher or sometimes as panel) allows you to quickly launch your frequently used programs. I rely heavily on the dock and I am going to share a few tips about using the dock effectively and customize its looks and position. You\\u2019ll learn the following in this tutorial: Basic usage of the dock: adding more applications and using shortcuts for launching applications. Customize the looks of the dock: Change the icon size, icon positions. Change the position: for single screen and multi-monitor setup Hide mounted disk from the dock Auto-hide or disable the dock Possibility of additional dock customization with dconf-editor Replace dock with other docking applications I\\u2019ll use the terms dock, panel and launcher in the tutorial. All of them refer to the same thing. Using the Ubuntu dock: Absolute basic that you must know If you are new to Ubuntu, you should know a few things about using the dock. You\\u2019ll eventually discover these dock features, I\\u2019ll just speed up the discovery process for you. Add new applications to the dock (or remove them) The steps are simple. Search for the application from the menu and run it. The running application appears in the dock, below all other icons. Right click on it and select the \\u201cAdd to Favorites\\u201d option. This will lock the icon to the dock. Right-click on the icon and select \\u201cAdd to Favorites\\u201d Removing an app icon from the doc is even easier. You don\\u2019t even need to run the application. Simply right click on it and select \\u201cRemove From Favorites\\u201d. Right-click on the icon and select \\u201cRemove from Favorites\\u201d Reorder icon position By default, new application icons are added after all the other icons on the launcher. You don\\u2019t have to live with it as it is. To change the order of the icons, you just need to drag and drop to the other position of your choice. No need to \\u201clock it\\u201d or any additional effort. It stays on that location until you make some changes again. Reorder Icons On Ubuntu Docks Right click to get additional options for some apps Left-clicking on an icon launches the application or bring it to focus if the application is already running. Right-clicking the icon gives you additional options. Different applications will have different options. For browsers, you can open a new private window or preview all the running windows. For file manager, you can go to all the bookmarked directories or preview opened windows. You can, of course, quit the application. Most applications will quit while some applications like Telegram will be minimized to the system tray. Use keyboard shortcut to launch applications quickly [Not many people know about this one] The dock allows you to launch an application in a single mouse click. But if you are like me, you can save that mouse click with a keyboard shortcut. Using the Super\\/Window key and a number key will launch the application on that position. If the application is already running, it is brought to focus, i.e. it appears in front of all the other running application windows. Since it is position-based, you should make sure that you don\\u2019t reorder the icons all the time. Personally, I keep Firefox at position 1, file manager at 2 and the alternate browser at 3 and so on until number 9. This way, I quickly launch the file manager with Super+2. I find it easier specially because I have a three screen setup and moving the mouse to the launcher on the first screen is a bit too much of trouble. You can enable or disable the dock on additional screen. I\\u2019ll show that to you later in this tutorial. Change the position of the dock By default, the dock is located on the left side of your screen. Some people like the launcher at the bottom, in a more traditional way. Ubuntu allows you to change the position of the dock. You can move it to the bottom or to the right side or on the top. I am not sure many people actually put the dock on the top or the right side, so moving the dock to the top is not an option here. Change Launcher Position To change the dock position, go to Settings-div class=\\\"wp-block-image\\\"figure class=\\\"aligncenter size-full\\\"img data-attachment-id=\\\"86662\\\" data-permalink=\\\"https:\\/\\/itsfoss.com\\/customize-ubuntu-dock\\/change-dock-position-ubuntu\\/\\\" data-orig-file=\\\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/itsfoss.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2021\\/01\\/change-dock-position-ubuntu.png?fit=800%2C450&ssl=1\\\" data-orig-size=\\\"800,450\\\" data-comments-opened=\\\"1\\\" data-image-meta=\\\"{\\\"aperture\\\":\\\"0\\\",\\\"credit\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"camera\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"caption\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"created_timestamp\\\":\\\"0\\\",\\\"copyright\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"focal_length\\\":\\\"0\\\",\\\"iso\\\":\\\"0\\\",\\\"shutter_speed\\\":\\\"0\\\",\\\"title\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"orientation\\\":\\\"0\\\"}\\\" data-image-title=\\\"change-dock-position-ubuntu\\\" data-image-description=\\\"\\\" data-medium-file=\\\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/itsfoss.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2021\\/01\\/change-dock-position-ubuntu.png?fit=300%2C169&ssl=1\\\" data-large-file=\\\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/itsfoss.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2021\\/01\\/change-dock-position-ubuntu.png?fit=800%2C450&ssl=1\\\" loading=\\\"lazy\\\" width=\\\"800\\\" height=\\\"450\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/itsfoss.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2021\\/01\\/change-dock-position-ubuntu.png?resize=800%2C450&ssl=1\\\" alt=\\\"Change Dock Position in Ubuntu\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-86662\\\" srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/itsfoss.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2021\\/01\\/change-dock-position-ubuntu.png?w=800&ssl=1 800w, https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/itsfoss.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2021\\/01\\/change-dock-position-ubuntu.png?resize=300%2C169&ssl=1 300w, https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/itsfoss.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2021\\/01\\/change-dock-position-ubuntu.png?resize=768%2C432&ssl=1 768w, https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/itsfoss.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2021\\/01\\/change-dock-position-ubuntu.png?resize=100%2C56&ssl=1 100w, https:\\/\\/i2.wp.com\\/itsfoss.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2021\\/01\\/change-dock-position-ubuntu.png?resize=150%2C84&ssl=1 150w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\\\" data-recalc-dims=\\\"1\\\" \\/figcaption\",\"2717\":null,\"840\":\"I love using dark mode in Ubuntu. It\\u2019s soothing on the eyes and makes the system look aesthetically more pleasing, in my opinion. One minor annoyance I noticed is with gedit text editor and if you use it with the dark mode in your system, you might have encountered it too. By default, gedit highlights the line where your cursor is. That\\u2019s a useful feature but it becomes a pain if you are using dark mode in your Linux system. Why? Because the highlighted text is not readable anymore. Have a look at it yourself: Text on the highlighted line is hardly visible If you select the text, it becomes readable but it\\u2019s not really a pleasant reading or editing experience. Selecting the text makes it better but that\\u2019s not a convenient thing to do for all lines The good thing is that you don\\u2019t have to live with it. I\\u2019ll show a couple of steps you can take to enjoy dark mode system and gedit together. Making gedit reader-friendly in dark mode You basically have two options: Disable highlight the current line but then you\\u2019ll have to figure out which line you are at. Change the default color settings but then the colors of the editor will be slightly different, and it won\\u2019t switch to light mode automatically if you change the system theme. It\\u2019s a workaround and compromise that you\\u2019ll have to make until the gedit or GNOME developers fix the issue. Option 1: Disable highlighting current line When you have gedit opened, click on the hamburger menu and select Preferences. Go to Preferences In the View tab, you should see the \\u201cHighlight current line\\u201d option under Highlighting section. Uncheck this. The effects are visible immediately. Disable highlighting current line Highlighting current line is a usable feature and if you want to continue using it, opt for the second option. Option 2: Change the editor color theme In the Preferences window, go to Font & Colors tab and change the color scheme to Oblivion, Solarized Dark or Cobalt. Change the color scheme As I mentioned earlier, the drawback is that when you switch the system theme to a light theme, the editor theme isn\\u2019t switched automatically to the light theme. A bug that should be fixed by devs There are several text editors available for Linux but for quick reading or editing a text file, I prefer using gedit. It\\u2019s a minor annoyance but an annoyance nonetheless. The developers should fix it in future version of this awesome text editor so that we don\\u2019t have to resort to these worarounds.

Here are some of the best open source forum software you can deploy on your servers. Just like our It\\u2019s FOSS Community forum, it is important to always build a platform where like-minded people can discuss, interact, and seek support. A forum gives users (or customers) a space to reach out for something that they cannot easily find on the Internet for the most part. If you are an enterprise, you may hire a team of developers and build your own forum the way you want but that adds a lot of cost to your budget. Fortunately, there are several impressive open source forum software that you can deploy on your server and you\\u2019re good to go! You will save a lot of money in the process and still get what you need. Here, I have compiled a list of best open source forum software that you can install on your Linux server. Best open source forum software to build a community portal In case you haven\\u2019t built a website yet, you might want to take a look at some open-source website creation tools before you deploy a forum. Note: The list is in no particular order of ranking. 1. Discourse (modern and popular) Discourse is the most popular modern forum software that people deploy to set up their discussion platforms. In fact, our It\\u2019s FOSS community forum utilizes the Discourse platform. It offers most of the essential features that I\\u2019m aware of which includes email notifications, moderation tools, style customization options, third-part integrations like Slack\\/WordPress, and more. It is completely free to self-host and you can find the project on GitHub as well. If you do not need the hassle of deploying it on a self-managed server, you can always choose to opt for managed services offered by Discourse itself (which will be certainly expensive). Discourse 2. Talkyard (inspired by Discourse and StackOverflow) Talkyard is completely free to use and an open-source project. It looks close to Discourse but there are distinctions if you inspect it. You get most of the key features from StackOverflow here along with all essential features that you would expect on a forum platform. It may not be a popular forum solution but if you want something similar to Discourse along with some interesting features, this is worth trying out. You can explore more about it in their GitHub page. Talkyard 3. Forem (Unique approach for a community platform, in beta) You may not have heard about it before, but it is what powers dev.to (which is an increasingly popular developer community website). It is still in beta, so you may or may not choose to experiment it on a production server. But, you can let them host it for you by filling a form on their official website and getting in touch with them. Even though there\\u2019s no official feature list to highlight everything, you do get many essential features and functionalities like community listing, shop, post formatting, etc, if we take dev.to as an example. You can read more about what it offers in their announcement post and explore the project on GitHub. Forem 4. NodeBB (Modern and full of features) NodeBB is an open-source forum software based on Node.js. It aims to be simple, elegant, and fast as well. Primarily, it is geared towards organizations and enterprises with managed hosting plans available. But, you can choose to host it yourself as well. You get a real-time native analytics feature along with chat and notification support as well. It also offers an API, if you want to integrate it with any of your existing product. It also supports moderation tools and tools to fight spam. You get some 3rd party integration support out of the box like WordPress, Mailchimp, etc. Explore more about it in their GitHub page or the official website. NodeBB 5. Vanilla Forums (enterprise focused) Vanilla Forums is primarily an enterprise focused forum software with essential features to brand your platform, offer a Q\\/A for customers, and also gives the ability to vote on posts. The user experience is geared with a modern look and is being used by the likes of EA, Adobe, and some other big shot companies. Of course, if you want to try the cloud-based Vanilla Forums (managed by a team of professionals) along with the access to some premium features, feel free to request a Demo. In either case, you can opt for the community edition, which is free to use with most of the latest features with the responsibility of hosting it yourself and managing it. You can explore more about it on their official website and GitHub page. Vanilla Forums Recommended Read: Best Open Source eCommerce Platforms to Build Online Shopping Websites Want to create an online shopping website? Here are some open source ecommerce platforms you can deploy on your own Linux server. 6. bbPress (from WordPress) bbPress is a solid forum software built by the creators of WordPress. It aims to provide a simple and snappy forum experience. The user interface would seem old-school but it is easy to use and offers the basic functionalities that you would normally look for in a forum software. The moderation tools are simple and easy to set up. You can extend the functionality using plugins available and choose from several themes available to tweak the look and feel of your forum. If you just want a simple forum platform with no fancy features, bbPress should be perfect. You can also check out their GitHub page for more information. bbPress 7. phpBB (classic forum software) If you want a traditional forum design and just want the basic functionalities, phpBB software is a good choice. Of course, you may not get the best user experience or the features, but it is functional and quite effective as a traditional-design forum plaform. Especially, for users comfortable with the traditional approach, it will be a simple and effective solution. Not just limited to the simplicity, but also it is way easier to set up with an average hosting provider. You get a 1-click installation feature on every shared hosting platform, so you do not need a lot of technical knowledge to set it up as well. You can explore more about it in their official website or the GitHub page. phpBB 8. Simple Machines Forum (another classic) Similar to php BB, Simple Machines forum is yet another basic (or simple) implementation of a forum platform. You may not be able to customize the look and feel by a long extent (not easily at least) but the default look is clean and offers a good user experience. Personally, I like it better than php BB, but you can head to their official website to explore more about it. Also, you can easily install Simple Machines Forum on any shared hosting service using the 1-click installation method. Simple Machines Forum 9. FluxBB (old school) FluxBB is yet another simple and lightweight open source forum. When compared to some others, it may not be super actively maintained but if you just want to deploy a basic forum with a few users, you can easily give this a try. You can explore more about it in their official website and the GitHub page. FluxBB 10. MyBB (less popular but worth a look) MyBB is a unique open-source forum software that offers a wide range of styles and includes essential features you\\u2019ll need. Starting from plugin support and moderation tools, you get everything necessary needed to manage a big community. It also supports private messaging to individual users similar to Discourse and similar forum software. It may not be a popular option but it checks out for most of the use-cases and it completely free. You might want to support and explore the project on GitHub as well. MyBB 11. Flarum (in beta) If you want something simpler and unique, have a look at Flarum. It is a lightweight forum software which aims to be mobile-first while offering a fast experience. It supports some third-party integrations and you can extend the functionality using extensions as well. Personally, it looks beautiful to me. I haven\\u2019t got a chance to try it you can take a look at its documentation and it is safe to assume that it features all the necessary features for a forum. It is worth noting that Flarum is fairly new so it is still in beta. You might want to deploy it on your test server first before taking a leap of faith on your production environment. Do check out their GitHub page for more details. Flarum Bonus: Lemmy (More like a Reddit alternative but a decent option) A federated alternative to Reddit built using Rust. The user interface is simple and some of you may not find it to be intuitive enough for an attractive forum experience. The federated network is still a work in progress but if you want a Reddit-like community platform, you can easily deploy it in your Linux server with moderation rules, moderators, and get started. It supports cross-posting (as seen in Reddit) along with other basic features of tagging, voting, user avatar, and more. You can explore more about through their official documentation and the GitHub page. Lemmy Can\\u2019t self-host? Let us help you Deploying open source applications and managing Linux servers takes some expertise and time. If you lack either but still want to have your own instance of open source software, we can help you out. With our new project, High on Cloud, you can leave the deployment and server management part to us while you work on growing your community forum. Wrapping Up Most of the open source forum software offer pretty much the same features for basic use-case. If you are looking for something specific, you might want to explore their documentations. Personally, I recommend Discourse. It is popular, modern looking and has a significant user base. What do you think is the best open source forum software? Did I miss any of your favorites?

Haruna Video Player: A Qt-based Free Video Player Haruna Video Player In case you\\u2019re not aware of mpv, it is a free and open-source command-line based media player. Okay, there is a minimalist GUI for MPV but at the core, it is command line. You might also find several open-source video players that are basically the GUI front-end to mpv. Haruna video player is one of them along with the ability to use youtube-dl. You can easily play local media files as well as YouTube content. Let me give you an overview of the features offered with this player. Features of Haruna Video Player You might find it a bit different from some other video players. Here\\u2019s what you get with Haruna video player: Ability to play YouTube videos directly using the URL Support playlists and you get to control them easily Ability to auto-skip based on some words in the subtitle. Control the playback speed Change the format to play (audio\\/video) using youtube-dl Plenty of keyboard shortcuts Easily take a screenshot from the video Option to add primary and secondary subtitle Change the file format of the screenshot Hardware decoding supported Color adjustments to improve the quality of what you watch Ability to tweak mouse and keyboard shortcuts to be able to quickly navigate and do what you want Tweak the UI (fonts, theme) Installing Haruna Video Player on Linux Unfortunately (or not), depending on what you prefer, you can only install it using Flatpak. You can install it on any Linux distribution using the Flatpak package. You can find it in AUR as well if you\\u2019re using an Arch-based system. But, if you do not prefer that, you may take a look at the source code on GitHub to see if you can build it yourself like a normal Gentoo user. Haruna Video Player Concluding Thoughts Haruna Video Player is a simple and useful GUI on top libmpv. The ability to play YouTube videos along with various file formats on the system is definitely something many users would like. The user interface is easy to get used to and offers some important customization options as well. Have you tried this video player already?

The simplest way to find the free disk space on Linux is to use df command. The df command stands for disk-free and quite obviously, it shows you the free and available disk space on Linux systems. df -h With -h option, it shows the disk space in human-readable format (MB and GB). Here\\u2019s the output of the df command for my Dell XPS system that has only Linux installed with encrypted disk: Checking free disk space with df command in Linux If the above output is confusing for you, don\\u2019t worry. I\\u2019ll explain a few things around checking available disk space in Linux. I\\u2019ll also show the GUI method for desktop Linux users. Method 1: Checking free disk space in Linux with df command (and understanding its output) When you use the df command to check disk space, it will show a bunch of \\u2018file systems\\u2019 with their size, used space and free space. Your actual disks should normally be listed as one of the following: \\/dev\\/sda \\/dev\\/sdb \\/dev\\/nvme0n1p This is not a hard and fast rule but it gives you an indication to easily recognize the actual disk from the crowd. Your Linux system might have several partitions on your disk for boot, EFI, root, swap, home etc. In such cases, these partitions are reflected with a number at the end of the \\u2018disk name\\u2019, like \\/dev\\/sda1, \\/dev\\/nvme0n1p2 etc. You could identify which partition is used for what purpose from its mount point. Root is mounted on \\/, EFI in \\/boot\\/EFI etc. In my case, I have used 41% of the 232 GB of disk space under root. If you have 2-3 big partitions (like root, home etc), you\\u2019ll have to make a calculation here. Understanding df command output tmpfs: The tmpfs (temporary filesystem) used for keeping files in virtual memory. You can ignore this virtual filesystem comfortably. udev: The udev filesystem is used for storing information related to devices (like USB, network card, CD ROM etc) plugged to your system. You may ignore it as well. \\/dev\\/loop: These are loop devices. You\\u2019ll see plenty of them while checking disk space in Ubuntu because of snap applications. Loops are virtual devices that allow normal files to be accessed as block devices. With the loop devices, snap applications are sandboxed in their own virtual disk. Since they are under root, you don\\u2019t need to count their used disk space separately. Missing disk space? Check if you have mounted all disks and partitions Keep in mind that the df command only shows disk space for mounted filesystems. If you are using more than one Linux distribution (or operating systems) on the same disk or you have multiple disks on your system, you need to mount them first in order to see the free space available on those partitions and disks. For example, my Intel NUC has two SSDs and 4 or 5 Linux distributions installed on them. It shows additional disks only when I mount them explicitly. You can use the lsblk command to see all the disks and partitions on your system. Once you have the disk partition name, you can mount it in this fashion: sudo mount \\/dev\\/sdb2 \\/mnt I hope this gives you a pretty good idea about checking hard drive space on Linux. Let\\u2019s see how to do it graphically. Method 2: Check free disk usage graphically Checking free disk space graphically is much easier in Ubuntu with the Disk Usage Analyzer tool. Disk Usage Analyzer Tool You\\u2019ll see all the actual disks and partitions here. You may have to mount some partitions by clicking on them. It displays the disk usage for all the mounted partitions. Disk usage check Checking free disk space with GNOME Disks utility Otherwise, the GNOME Disks utility is also pretty handy tool. GNOME Disks Tool Start the tool and select the disk. Select a partition to see the free disk space. If a partition is not mounted, mount it first by clicking the \\u2018play\\u2019 icon. Free Disk Space Check in Ubuntu Desktop I think all major desktop environments have some sort of graphical tool to check the disk usage on Linux. You can search for it in the menu of your desktop Linux system. Conclusion There can be more ways and tools to check the disk space of course. I showed you the most common command line and GUI methods for this purpose. I also explained a few things that might trouble you in understanding the disk usage. Hope you like it.

A throwback to the effects rich movies that involves magic. Movie stars Srinath, Sundarkrisna Urs & Lakshmi in lead roles. Shockingly, Lakshmi already a well established & a well known actress than both the leads has a very little screen time throughout the movie but will sear into your memory in the climax with her mannerisms when possessed by spirit. Real highlight of the movie is SundarKrishna Urs as Ugrayya, an evil tantrik who terrorizes the village via dark magic, Srinath an educated man, who returns to his village goes toe to toe with Ugrayya to expose him but failing every-time. The dark magic & a \\\"hero's journey\\\" storyline to learn the art of magic to avenge his defeat is always an appealing plotline especially when you are invested to see an evil character like Ugrayya fall. Sundarkrishna urs oozes menace in this movie & as a despicable villain its easy to be invested in the storyline to see Urs's personification of evil to be defeated, although the main face-off is a bit underwhelming. Movie mixes mysticism, mythology & dark magic & does it without the end product being cheesy & the acting being over the top. It seems much more concise as it concentrates on main storlyline & unlike other movies doesn't deviate from it there are no parallel story threads, or an out of the place romantic storyline to dilute the theme, which allows for an invested viewing experience a rare thing for a kannada movie. Overall a compact movie that does a good job building its mystical world & offers an engaging story & a villain we can all agree to hate. Halli gombe, Belli rambe - Comedy - 2\\/5 - Available on Youtube Malaashri was an icon in the 90s who could pretty much elevate any sub par movie & in this is one such example. Movie stars Gurudutt, Malashri, Girija lokesh & Chi Uday Shankar in lead roles. Gurudutt stars as a momma's boy who sides with his mom Girija lokesh as she rules the house with an iron fist causing Malaashri's sister, marries to Gurudutt's brother, to return to her home as a punishment for standing against her mother-in-law. So Malaashri comes up with this brilliant, elaborate & undoubtedly senseless scheme that is so 90s to pose as an innocent village girl, with a fake family & then woo Gurudutt & enter his home as his wife & teach a lesson to her demanding mother-in-law. Movie is full of outdated comedy bits that is more grating than gratifying, Gurudutt as a lead is unbearable & in contrast to Malaashri's searing screen presence everything else fades away. This Movie is completely owned by Malaashri's oomph factor & charisma. Chi Uday Shankar's one liners does get a chuckle out of you now & then but rest of the comic relief seems tasteless & most of the comedic gags falls flat. Hello doctor - Educational?\\/Parody - 0.5\\/5 - Available on Youtube This one was recommended by a friend & its safe to say i wouldn't be asking him for any recommendation in future. This movie borders on being a soft porn\\/educational\\/drama movie & stays in limbo without being categorized into any, it wont be a stretch to call it a dark comedy though. Movie starts of in a worse possible way where a bunch of men are having nightmares & killing themselves for some reason. That reason being they are all infected with HIV while they got drunk & gangraped a handicapped girl. After this grand opening movie tries hard to empathize with these HIV infected rapists while as a viewer i was just wondering what kind of sociopath the director is & what kind of head injury did he suffer to conclude unapologetic rapists needs sympathy as well. After this tone-deaf start movie starts to throw AIDS into any person it wants to & pretend its a social drama, all the while it uses multiple shower scenes of a horny wife as a filler & surprise, surprise even this marriage drama has an AIDS angle. It even has a scene with an actual doctor who tries to educate viewers that AIDS is transmitted ONLY via homosexual relation & with that it fails at what little \\\"education\\\" it has to offer. The only thing i remember from this poor excuse for an \\\"AIDS awareness programme\\\" is the segment involving a clueless husband, who himself looks like a diseased thriller manju, handling his horny wife with an lackadaisical dialogue delivery. The defeated dialogue \\\"Kastuuuri\\\" is a sight to watch & hear & is so bad its the only good aspect of the movie. Only thing I would recommend is to only watch the soulless acting of the \\\"thriller manju\\\" lookalike doctor & his dialogue delivery & acting is a thing of beauty & would have been a meme treasure in right hands. While the horny wife is acting her ass off the clueless actor just stands around like a tree repeating the dialogue & goddamn its hilarious levels of bad acting I have ever seen & I have seen some bad bad movies. 27 Maavalli circle - Thriller - 3.5\\/5 Available on Youtube This movie in an unofficial remake of Audrey hepburn's \\\"Wait Until Dark\\\". Movie stars Avinash, who dons a questionable wardrobe throughout the movie, Umashree & Devaraj in his debut role. T.N. Narasimhan who is the director\\/producer also plays a lead role in the movie. Movie follows Narasimhan as a master thief who hires Devaraj & Somashekar rao to swindle a blind woman to collect a lost or possibly misplaced doll in her home. Tn Narasimhan, Devaraj, Somashekar form a gang where they impersonate multiple characters as they try to terrorize a blind woman into recall where she has misplaced the doll, which has valuable diamonds hidden in it. The elaborate schemes & counter schemes are fun to watch & after the initial 20mins of movie which is all over the place it settles into its own tune. It embraces its play like structure & allows each character to walk in flex their acting muscle & go back & make room for the rest. Adapting a very strong source material with brilliant acting talent & it gives each character their own space to express themselves which as a whole is a treat to watch, right story, right actors & decision to shoot it like a play localized in a home gives it an air of freshness. Overall a strong source material, coupled with fine acting makes this work although it seem more like a radio play enacted on screen, it works as it has the cosy feeling of a quality & an earnest radio play. Madhu chandra - Drama - 1\\/5 - Available on YouTube Madhu chandra stars Shankarnag, Jayamala & Ramakrishna in its lead roles. Movie starts off in a picturesque beach-side resort where Shankarnag & his wife Jayamala are on their honeymoon trip. The movie spends its entire first half showing how idyllic their relationship is & as predicted the couple drift apart from each other. While Shankar nag is effortless in his portrayal as a devoted husband, Jayamala falls short in her role. When the couple starts to drift from one another Jayamala fails to match the intensity of a sudden bitterness in the relationship, that comes naturally to Shankarnag. Movie also tries to hint a much more with a ton of foreboding scenes with Ramakrishna which is left open for interpretation throughout the movie. As we slog through the borefest of a movie wondering whether there is any sort of plotline to this movie which so far has bored us with scenes after scenes of lead pair playfully enjoying their vacation & then continues to bore with their sudden distrust for each other. If you are still awake then movie thrusts in a murder out of the blue to raise the stakes & then finds the murderer & haphazardly closes all the paper-thin plot-lines before viewer can complete a yawn. Movie is all over the place & is an inexcusable mess of a movie & pairing a weak actress like Jayamala alongside Ramakrishna & Shankarnag who are honestly trying & wasting their time is actually a crime. Gagana - Drama - 3\\/5 - Available on YouTube Gagana a product of Dorai-Bhagawan comes with all the bells & whistles their production is known for. Starring Anant nag, Kushboo, Srinath, Leelavati the movie boasts of quality leads & a quality supporting cast. Its a light-hearted family drama with no serious stakes & is watchable due to its charismatic leads in Kushboo & Anant nag. The first half of a movie has a 3 stooges feel to it with Slapstick comedy intermixed with melodrama, the friction between Kushboo's character & Anantnag is a fun watch, Kushboo as a happy-go-lucky lead in first half is a breezy watch, however the second half tones down on this as movie enters its melodramatic phase & loses the steam. Plot wise it talks about how a widower Anant nag overcomes his barrier to accept Kushboo(titular Gagana) as his soulmate. First half of the movies is much better & serves to reel in its audience with a lovable & bubbly character in Kushboo & slapstick office shenanigans, while second half tries to balance the tone the sudden shift from a playful character to a devoted lover is jarring, but thanks to the talented cast none of it gets in your way for enjoying a well crafted lighthearted family drama.

Now that things are back to normal, I said I'd move out in the next 6 months and my parents are pretending those conversations never happened and saying I can't move out until marriage (which is probably never because I haven't been interested in anyone for 5+ years now and don't see it changing anytime soon.) This is so frustrating and i'm losing my mind. I'm so angry that I feel like I should just move out one day and cut these people out of my life completely. \\u200b EDIT: Since many are asking\\/ talking about financial situation - I don't have any financial dependence on them. Instead, I give them 10k a month for household expenses. I told them that they don't need this money anyway because my grandfather has an empty flat. I suggested that they move there and rent out the current house and I get my own place. This way they'll make more money, their loneliness will be reduced because my extended family is in that area, and they'll have fewer expenses (handling 3 people instead of 4). They're just being stubborn and refusing for no reason or \\\"marriage\\\".

Despite it being an excellent web browser, you may prefer the popular Google Chrome browser. If you are wondering how to install Google Chrome on Fedora, let me show you two ways of installing Google Chrome, graphical method and command line method. GUI method 1: Install Chrome from the software center by enabling Fedora third-party repository GUI method 2: Download RPM file from Google Chrome\\u2019s website CLI method: Install Chrome from the Fedora third-party repository, everything using commands (same as GUI method 1) It is up to you which method you prefer. Your Google Chrome on Fedora will be getting regular updates via the system updates in all the three methods. Method 1: Install Google Chrome on Fedora from the Software Center Fedora provides a third-party repository that contains some popular proprietary software, graphics driver. Google Chrome is one of them. First step, make sure to enable third-party repositories in Fedora. You should see this option in the software center itself. Step1: Fedora Third Party Repositories Once you have it enabled, simply search for Chrome in the software center: Step 2: Search for Chrome In Fedora Software Center And install it from there: Step 3: Install Chrome Fedora Can it be any easier than this? I don\\u2019t think either :) Method 2: Installing Google Chrome on Fedora from Chrome website If you do not want to enable the third-party repository, that\\u2019s okay. You don\\u2019t have to. You can download the RPM file from Chrome\\u2019s website, double-click on it and install it. Yes, installing RPM file on Fedora is that simple. Visit Google Chrome\\u2019s website and click on the download button. Get Google Chrome Then select the .rpm package and click on \\u201cAccept and Install\\u201d. Once the download is over, double click on the file and click install when prompted at the package manager. Type your password and wait until the process is done. That\\u2019s super easy, right? Let\\u2019s see somewhat complicated method (if you are not a terminal fan). Method 3: Install Chrome on Fedora using command line Firstly, you need to add extra Fedora repositories (that you saw in method 1): sudo dnf install fedora-workstation-repositories And then enable Google Chrome repository. sudo dnf config-manager --set-enabled google-chrome To install the Google Chrome stable release, run the following command at your terminal. sudo dnf install google-chrome-stable You should get a warning for importing the GPG key, enter y to continue. You are adding the Google Chrome repository. The package comes from this repository, directly from Google. Conclusion Installing Google chrome on Fedora is fairly easy, even if you use the command line. It\\u2019s pretty much the same as installing Chrome on Ubuntu except the third-party repository part. Now that you have installed it, you may want to check our list of Google Chrome keyboard shortcuts to use the browser faster.

There are no tv shows for adults and teens and we all know that tv is the biggest platform which can reach maximum audiences but we dont have anything which we can say is good. I u\\/i-love-chitchats-7 have made a sub for people who want to change this trend and make new quality shows for teens, adults and kids, basically it's about bringing quality and innovative content in India for ANY demographic. Though this sub is for comic artists, animators and writers, here people can also ask plot or pacing related questions, also about the condition of animation and producing in india. Here you can post your self made comics, different ideas, self made animations, you can share your stories which you have written or take ideas on how you can improve your stories or what you can add more to it.

Even though WhatsApp tries to clarify and re-assure the change in the policies, users have made their mind while considering the benefits of using privacy alternatives to WhatsApp. But, what are some useful and impressive alternatives to WhatsApp? In this article, let us take a look at some of the best options. Private messengers that do not violate your privacy There could be plenty of private messaging services. I have kept my focus on messaging services with the following criteria in mind: Mobile and desktop availability Group chats and channels Voice and video calls Emojis and sticker support Privacy and encryption Basically, private messaging app that cater to the need of a common user. Note: The list is in no particular order of ranking. 1. Session Key Features: End-to-end Encryption Blockchain-based Decentralized Does not require phone number No data collected by Session Lets you create and manage open\\/closed groups (open groups are public channels) Voice messages Cross-platform with desktop apps Open-Source Session is technically a fork of Signal and tries to go one step further by not requiring phone numbers. It isn\\u2019t a typical WhatsApp replacement but if you want something different with privacy options, this could be it. You will have to create a Session ID (that you can share to add contacts or ask your contacts to share theirs). If you delete the app, you will lose your ID, so you need to keep your recovery pass safely. Unlike Signal, it does not rely on a centralized server but blockchain-based, i.e. decentralized. That\\u2019s good for reliability technically, but I\\u2019ve noticed some significant delays in sending\\/receiving messages. If you\\u2019re tech-savvy, and want the absolute best for privacy, this could be it. But, it may not be a great option for elders and general consumers. For more information, you can check out my original Session overview. Session 2. Signal Key Features: End-to-End encryption Almost no data collection (Except your phone number) Supports Emojis and Stickers Lets you create and manage Groups Voice\\/Video calling supported Cross-platform support with desktop apps Open-Source Signal is my personal favorite when it comes to privacy alternatives to WhatsApp. I\\u2019ve made the switch for years, but I didn\\u2019t have all my contacts in Signal. Fast-forward to 2021, I have most of my contacts on Signal. Signal is the best blend of open-source and privacy. They\\u2019ve improved a lot over the years and is safe to assume as a perfect alternative to WhatsApp. You get almost every essential feature compared to WhatsApp. However, just because it does not store your data, you may not be able to access all the messages of your smartphone on Desktop. In addition to that, it relies on local backup (which is protected by a passphrase) instead of cloud backups. So, you will have to head to the settings, start the backup, safely copy the passcode of the backup, check where the local backup gets stored, and make sure you don\\u2019t delete it. You can explore more about Signal in our original coverage and learn how to install Signal in Linux. Signal Recommended Read: 9 Decentralized, P2P and Open Source Alternatives to Mainstream Social Media Platforms Like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Reddit 3. Telegram Key Features: End-to-end Encryption (with Secret chat option) Cloud-based (no need to back up your chats, it\\u2019s all in the cloud) Ability to create public channels Create and manage groups Voice\\/Video Call Offers a better privacy policy to WhatsApp Supports Emojis and Stickers Client-side Open-Source Telegram may not be the best bet for privacy, but it is certainly better than WhatsApp in several regards. By default, the chats aren\\u2019t end-to-end encrypted but the convenience of having all the history in the cloud without needing to backup while having the secret chat option for encryption is a good deal for common consumers. Not just limited to that, you also get native desktop apps and the client-side apps are open-source. Of course, I won\\u2019t recommend it over others for privacy-conscious users, but sometimes you just need a messenger that works, offers convenience, and respects the user\\u2019s privacy even if the chats are stored in the cloud. Telegram 4. Threema (Paid) Key Features: End-to-end Encryption Does not require a phone number Lets you create and manage groups Ability to add polls Voice\\/Video calls Switzerland-based (known for best privacy policies) Cross-platform (with Threema Web for PC, no native desktop apps) Open-Source Threema was among the best choices in the list of private messengers available out there. Initially, it wasn\\u2019t open-source, which was a bummer. But, now, Threema is completely open-source! Threema offers the best features that you\\u2019d always want in a messenger. However, it is a paid-only app. Of course, if your friends\\/contacts do not mind paying for one of the best privacy alternatives to WhatsApp, you can easily recommend them this! Threema 5. Element Key Features: End-to-end Encryption Does not require phone number Supports creating large public groups and closed groups as well Utilizes Decentralized Matrix network Voice\\/Video Calls Cross-platform with desktop apps Open-Source Element is yet another fantastic WhatsApp alternative that is built keeping privacy in mind. It may not be a perfect replacement for a few contacts but if you\\u2019re looking for an \\u201cAll in One\\u201d platform for personal messaging and work as well, Element can be the perfect pick. It was originally known as Riot, and then it rebranded to Element. Do note that it can be a little overwhelming if you wanted a simple alternative, but it\\u2019s great for privacy and security. Element Wrapping Up With the transparent policy updates to WhatsApp, more users are getting aware about the disadvantages of using a product owned by big tech companies. Hence, we need WhatsApp alternatives more than ever. Of course, it is not easy to switch and convince other less tech-savvy users. But, it is certainly worth it. What do you think about the best WhatsApp alternatives which offer better privacy?

I am currently doing a study that looks at Hindu-Muslim conflict from the point of a Hindu; in doing so, I am trying to better understand the societal, religious, and political interconnections that lead to these conflicts. Being a Hindu myself, I know that this subject is quite contentious, yet the Hindu-Muslim conflict in India is widely known between nearly all ethnicities. For that, it has also had spillover effects on the political and social realm. For my study, I need to have around 40 Hindu participants who are from the United States. Because I am looking at the Hindu-Muslim conflict, India was my prime geographic source. So, having a participant from India would skew my results. I would like outside results. My survey only asks you to fill out 16 (short) free-response questions. There will be short paragraph excerpts for you to read as well to guide you through. This should take one hour; however, I allow you to take one week to fill out the Google Form. You do not need to be knowledgeable in historical Hindu-Muslim conflicts at all; you simply need to know your own political beliefs. The only personal information which I will need from you is your name, email, the generation of immigration, and which date you started the survey. By generation of immigration, I am referring to whether you are a first or second-generation immigrant in the United States. All of this is based on an honor system, I am not asking you to overturn any documentation at all. I would heavily appreciate it if you can participate in this one hour survey that analyzes Hindu-Muslim conflict. I am looking for all perspectives: conservative, liberal, undecided, and moderate. These will greatly help me in assessing how to bridge the gap in conflict. If you are interested in participating in this survey, please message me personally on Reddit. Thank you so much, I very much appreciate it.

The thought makes me want to throw up. I lost my older sister in a road accident and so I'm really averse to the idea of being in the driver's seat and causing harm to someone else. So far, I've been able to avoid driving altogether. I live in a central part of town, everything is close by and I could use the metro+an auto to go anywhere I needed. Due to the pandemic though, I really felt like I should be able to drive, because not only was I dependent on others I wasn't able to help out family with stuff. Decided it's time to grow a pair and learn. So tldr, looking for a good safe place to learn to drive - not too crowded and a place where I can learn the essentials hopefully to get over the fear. My dad's a good teacher and a good driver so I'm not sure if going to a driving school is compulsory or if I can learn from him and take the test later.

This is called the GRUB screen. Yes, it is written in all capital letters. Remember this screen? This is GRUB In this chapter of the Linux Jargon Buster series, I\\u2019ll tell you what Grub is and what is it used for. I\\u2019ll also briefly touch upon the configuration and customization part. What is GRUB? GRUB is a complete program for loading and managing the boot process. It is the most common bootloader for Linux distributions. A bootloader is the first software that runs when a computer starts. It loads the kernel of the operating system and then the kernel initializes the rest of the operating system: shell, display manager, desktop environment, etc. Boot loader vs boot manager I didn\\u2019t want to confuse you at this stage but this topic needs to be introduced before going on. There is a blurry line between a bootloader and a boot manager. You already know that the bootloader starts first and then loads the kernel into memory and executes it. A boot manager program allows you to choose between operating systems, if there is more than one on your system. A boot manager doesn\\u2019t load the OS directly, With Linux kernel version 3.3, the Linux kernel includes a built-in EFI bootloader. In fact, any operating system that is capable of working the EFI system includes an EFI bootloader. In EFI capable systems, the firmware reads the EFI system partition (ESP) to locate the EFI files for boot information. GRUB is both a bootloader and a boot manager. I\\u2019ll come back to GRUB in a moment. First, let\\u2019s see other GRUB-like programs. Trivia GRUB is acronym for GRand Unified Bootloader. What are some other boot managing programs similar to GRUB? GRUB is the most popular boot manager for Linux. But it is not the only one. There is the highly customizable rEFInd boot manager that some Linux users love. Customized rEFInd Boot Manager Screen | Image Credit There is also systemd-boot text-based boot manager. You can guess that this is exclusively for systemd-based Linux distributions. Some distributions such as Pop OS, use the systemd-boot. systemd-Boot in Pop OS | Image Credit Accessing or editing GRUB The usual GRUB screen you see is its menu interface. It allows you to choose which operating systems to boot, if there is more than one on your machine. You can also choose to load a different kernel if your Linux distribution has more than one installed. Depending upon the configuration set by the Linux distribution, you may have some other entries on the GRUB menu. You can edit a GRUB menu entry by pressing the \\u201ce\\u201d key. This way, you can change the kernel parameters before loading it. For example, in some cases, disabling the graphics driver from the kernel helps you with Linux system stuck at boot. You can also enter the command line menu of GRUB using the \\u201cc\\u201d key at the GRUB menu interface. GRUB configuration file Any changes you make to GRUB from the menu interface is temporary. If you want to make some permanent changes to GRUB, such as changing the default timeout, you can change the configuration file after you boot into your Linux system. The default GRUB configuration file is located at \\/etc\\/default\\/grub. There is also a \\/etc\\/default\\/grub.d directory. You may edit the \\/etc\\/default\\/grub file directly, however it is advised to make additional changes by adding config files (.cfg files) in this directory. Default GRUB Config File You must update GRUB for the changes to take into effect. In fact, whenever you install an additional Linux on your system, it will try to overwrite the existing GRUB config with its own. GRUB customizer for easily customizing GRUB If you think editing a file with a text editor in the terminal is not something you feel comfortable with, you can use a graphical tool called GRUB Customizer. It allows you to change the boot order, default timeout etc. You can also use it to change the background of GRUB with a custom wallpaper. GRUB Customizer can be installed in Ubuntu 20.04 from Universe repository and via PPA in Ubuntu 18.04. It is available via AUR in Arch Linux based distributions. Conclusion I have touched everything on the surface. EFI, boot loading and GRUB itself is detailed and complicated topic and not in the scope of this article. This article intended to give you a high-level overview of the GRUB boot program. Perhaps I\\u2019ll write a detailed guide on GRUB explaining the low-level details. For now, if you want to learn more about GRUB, you can access the GRUB documentation in your Linux terminal using the info grub command. GRUB Manual can be accessed via Terminal I hope you have a tad bit better understanding of what GRUB is now. Here\\u2019s a GIF to humor you. What Is GRUB? UEFI don\\u2019t hurt me, no more\\u2026 :) I may not have answered all questions you have about GRUB. Please feel free to let me know in the comment section. I may update the article with your questions or suggestions.\",\"873\":\"This quick tutorial shows the steps to get a newer version of Mesa drivers on Ubuntu, be it stable release or cutting-edge development release. What is Mesa? Mesa itself is not a graphics card like Nvidia or AMD. Instead, it provides open source software implementation of OpenGL, Vulkan, and some other graphics API specifications for Intel and AMD graphics hardware. With Mesa, you can play high-end games and use applications that require such graphics libraries. More information on Mesa can be found in this article. How to install Mesa on Ubuntu? Mesa comes preinstalled on Ubuntu with the open source graphics drivers of Radeon, Intel and Nvidia (sometimes). Though it probably won\\u2019t be the latest Mesa version. You can check if your system uses Mesa and the installed versions using this command: glxinfo | grep Mesa If for some reasons (like playing games), you want to install a newer version of Mesa, this tutorial will help you with that. Since, you\\u2019ll be using PPA, I highly recommend reading my in-depth guide on PPA. Attention! Installing new Mesa graphics drivers may also need a newer Linux kernel. It will be a good idea to enable HWE kernel on Ubuntu to reduce the chances of conflict with the kernel. HWE Kernel gives you the latest stable kernel used by Ubuntu on an older LTS release. Install the latest stable version of Mesa driver in Ubuntu [Latest point release] The Kisak-mesa PPA provides the latest point release of Mesa. You can use it by entering the following commands one by one in the terminal: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kisak\\/kisak-mesa sudo apt update sudo apt install mesa It will give you the latest Mesa point release. Remove it and go back to original Mesa driver If you are facing issues and do not want to use the newer version of Mesa, you can revert to the original version. Install PPA Purge tool first: sudo apt install ppa-purge And then use it to remove the PPA as well as the Mesa package version installed by this PPA. sudo ppa-purge ppa:kisak\\/kisak-mesa Install the latest Mesa graphics drivers in Ubuntu [Bleeding edge] If you want the latest Mesa drivers as they are being developed, this is what you need. There is this awesome PPA that provides open source graphics drivers packages for Radeon, Intel and Nvidia hardware. The best thing here is that all driver packages are automatically built twice a day, when there is an upstream change. If you want the absolute latest Mesa drivers on Ubuntu and do not want to take the trouble of installing it from the source code, use this PPA by Oibaf. The PPA is available for 20.04, 20.10 and 21.04 at the time of writing this article. It is no longer updated for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. Open the terminal and use the following commands one by one: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:oibaf\\/graphics-drivers sudo apt update sudo apt install mesa This will give you the latest Mesa drivers. Remove it and go back to original Mesa driver You can remove the PPA and the installed latest Mesa driver using the ppa-purge tool. Install it first: sudo apt-get install ppa-purge Now use it to disable the PPA you had added and revert the Mesa package to the version provided by Ubuntu officially. sudo ppa-purge ppa:oibaf\\/graphics-drivers I hope this quick tutorial was helpful in getting a newer version of Mesa on Ubuntu.

You can use it for free, opt for paid plans, or simply host it yourself. Twake: A Modern Open-Source Nextcloud-like Collaboration Platform We\\u2019ve covered Nextcloud as one of the finest options to facilitate remote working and collaboration. At It\\u2019s FOSS, we use it to store our internal documents, manage tasks via Kanban board and more. I\\u2019m sure you will find several other options as collaboration platforms. Here, I\\u2019m going to give you a brief introduction on something that I stumbled upon i.e. Twake. Twake is a modern take on a collaboration platform which aims for a rich user experience along with useful features as well. Unlike Nextcloud or ownCloud, you can opt to use the official hosted instance. You can also self-host Twake on your server just as you do with Nextcloud or Owncloud. To test how it works and what it offers, I signed up for an account on their official instance with a free account. Let\\u2019s take a look at some key highlights of Twake. Features of Twake You get all the features you\\u2019ll find in a standard collaboration platform. You have tools to: Store documents Manage to-do lists Create Kanban project boards with tasks deadlines, labels, subtasks and calendar view Shared calendar Video conferencing Slack like discussion boards Collaboratively edit documents, even MS Office documents Share documents or invite outsiders to discussions The features that you can make use of will depend on what you\\u2019re using. For instance, if you self-host it, you will have no restrictions and can control whatever you need. But, if you opt for the free plan on the official instance, you will be limited a single workspace, no guest collaborators, and a few other restrictions. Here, I shall list all the key features and leave the rest for you to explore: Collaborative messaging Ability to create different channels (like Slack, Rocket.chat etc) Create tasks and manage them Board view of tasks Document management support Calendar view with task as well Unlimited message history (premium or self-hosted) Unlimited members (premium or self-hosted) Direct Messaging support Invite external members Guest collaborators (premium or self-hosted) Application integrations like Jitsi, Giphy Cross-platform desktop support (Linux, Windows, and macOS) Mobile apps for Android and iOS Can be self-hosted Installing Twake client on Linux Desktop & Server For desktop, you just have to head to the download page and get the AppImage file. You might want to read how to use AppImage files in Linux if you don\\u2019t know about it. Twake.app If you want to self-host it, you should go through the official documentation to get the necessary information. Our DevOps team deployed it on our test server using Docker containers and it worked pretty well in our limited testing. Can\\u2019t self-host? Let us help you Deploying open source applications and managing Linux servers takes some expertise and time. If you lack either but still want to have your own instance of open source software like Twake, we can help you out. With our new project, High on Cloud, you can leave the deployment and server management part to us while you work on growing your business and community. Closing Thoughts Twake is developed by LINAGORA, a France based open source company. Their servers are hosted in EU and they are GDPR compliant. Twake looks to be an incredibly promising collaborative platform while providing a rich user experience. I do find it a bit slow at login page so this is something they could improve. But other than that, it\\u2019s a good alternative to platforms like Trello, Sunsama, Asana etc. What do you think about Twake?

Owing to my terrible experience earlier with Rto (they won't accept my bike chassis change application for 1 whole month), I paid RTO agent Sharrif. Paid him 500\\u20b9 advance and the rest 1000 were to be paid when the NOC is done. Which as per him would have taken a maximum of 15 day - so around 21st Jan. But of course, on 21st it wasn't done. He insisted I leave Bangalore with the bike and within a max of another 15 days my original bike registration and the NOC will be sent to me by post. It has been more than a year now and I'm still waiting for both. After each subsequent call his demand of money increases. From 2000, 2500 to 3000 now. If I ask why so - he is abusive and rude. And the money is to be paid upfront before any thing is done. Tried calling police who wants me to physically be present to even listen to the complaint. Posted on Twitter @tdkarnataka - some stupid response saying \\\"noc is having technical issues\\\". Issues which I guess still persists. Now, I would like to get my registration card and preferably NOC, without paying the ransom. How do I do that? I understand I can't file RTI online for Bangalore transport. So what are my options?

Arch Linux, Ubuntu, Fedora, everyone has dropped the support for this older architecture. But, what if you have vintage hardware with you that still needs to be revived or you want to make use of it for something? Fret not, there are still a few options left to choose from for your 32-bit system. In this article, I\\u2019ve tried to compile some of the best Linux distributions that will keep on supporting 32-bit platform for next few years. Top Linux distributions that still offer 32-bit support This list is a bit different from our earlier list of Linux distributions for old laptops. Even 64-bit computers can be considered old if they were released before 2010. This is why some suggestions listed there included distros that only support 64-bit now. The information presented here are correct as per my knowledge and findings but if you find otherwise, please let me know in the comment section. Before you go on, I suppose you know how to check if you have a 32 bit or 64 bit computer. 1. Debian Image Credits: mrneilypops \\/ Deviantart Debian is a fantastic choice for 32-bit systems because they still support it with their latest stable release. At the time of writing this, the latest stable release Debian 10 \\u201cbuster\\u201d offers a 32-bit version and is supported until 2024. If you\\u2019re new to Debian, it is worth mentioning that you get solid documentation for everything on their official wiki. So, it shouldn\\u2019t be an issue to get started. You can browse through the available installers to get it installed. However, before you proceed, I would recommend referring to the list of things to remember before installing Debian in addition to its installation manual. Minimum System Requirements: 512 MB RAM 10 GB Disk Space 1 GHz Processor (Pentium 4 or equivalent) Debian 2. Slax If you just want to quickly boot up a device for some temporary work, Slax is an impressive option. It is based on Debian but it aims to be a portable and fast option that is meant to be run through USB devices or DVDs. You can download the 32-bit ISO file from their website for free or purchase a rewritable DVD\\/encrypted pendrive with Slax pre-installed. Of course, this isn\\u2019t meant to replace a traditional desktop operating system. But, yes, you do get the 32-bit support with Debian as its base. Minimum System Requirements: RAM: 128 MB (offline usage) \\/ 512 MB (for web browser usage) CPU: i686 or newer Slax 3. AntiX Image Credits: Opensourcefeed Yet another impressive Debian-based distribution. AntiX is popularly known as a systemd-free distribution which focuses on performance while being a lightweight installation. It is perfectly suitable for just about any old 32-bit system. To give you an idea, it just needs 256 MB RAM and 2.7 GB storage space at the very least. Not just easy to install, but the user experience is focused for both newbies and experienced users as well. You should get the latest version based on Debian\\u2019s latest stable branch available. Minimum System Requirements: RAM: 256 MB of RAM CPU: PIII systems Disk space: 5 GB of drive space AntiX 4. openSUSE openSUSE is an independent Linux distribution that supports 32-bit systems as well. Even though the latest regular version (Leap) does not offer 32-bit images, the rolling release edition (Tumbleweed) does provide 32-bit image. It will be an entirely different experience if you\\u2019re new. However, I suggest you to go through the reasons why you should be using openSUSE. It is mostly focused for developers and system administrators but you can utilize it as an average desktop user as well. It is worth noting that openSUSE is not meant to run on vintage hardware \\u2014 so you have to make sure that you have at least 2 GB RAM, 40+ GB storage space, and a dual core processor. Minimum System Requirements: Pentium 4 1.6 GHz or higher processor 1 GB physical RAM 5 GB Hard Disk openSUSE 5. Emmabunt\\u00fcs Emmabuntus is an interesting distribution that aims to extend the life of the hardware to reduce waste of raw materials with 32-bit support. As a group they\\u2019re also involved in providing computers and digital technologies to schools. It offers two different editions, one based on Ubuntu and the other based on Debian. If you want a longer 32-bit support, you may want to go with the Debian edition. It may not be the best option, but with a number of pre-configured software to make the Linux learning experience easy and 32-bit support, it is a decent option if you want to support their cause in the process. Minimum System Requirements: 512 MB RAM Hard Drive: 2 GB Pentium processor or equivalent Emmanbuntus 6. NixOS Nixos KDE Edition (Image Credits: Distrowatch) NixOS is yet another independent Linux distribution that supports 32-bit systems. It focuses on providing a reliable system where packages are isolated from each other. This may not be directly geared towards average users but it is a KDE-powered usable distribution with a unique approach to package management. You can learn more about its features from its official website. RAM: 768 MB 8 GB Disk Space Pentium 4 or equivalent NixOS 7. Gentoo Linux If you\\u2019re an experienced Linux user and looking for a 32-bit Linux distributions, Gentoo Linux should be a great choice. You can easily configure, compile, and install a kernel through package manager with Gentoo Linux if you want. Not just limited to its configurability, which it is popularly known for, you will also be able to run it without any issues on older hardware. Even if you\\u2019re not an experienced user and want to give it a try, simply read through the installation instructions and you will be in for an adventure. Minimum System Requirements: 256 MB RAM Pentium 4 or AMD equivalent 2.5 GB Disk Space Gentoo Linux 8. Devuan Devuan is yet another systemd-free distribution. It is technically a fork of Debian, just without systemd and encouraging Init freedom. It may not be a very popular Linux distribution for an average user but if you want a systemd-free distribution and 32-bit support, Devuan should be a good option. Minimum System Requirements: RAM: 1 GB CPU: Pentium 1.0 GHz Devuan 9. Void Linux Void Linux is an interesting distribution independently developed by volunteers. It aims to be a general purpose OS while offering a stable rolling release cycle. It features runit as the init system instead of systemd and gives you the option of several desktop environments. It has an extremely impressive minimum requirement specification with just 96 MB of RAM paired up with Pentium 4 (or equivalent) chip. Try it out! Minimum System Requirements: 96 MB RAM Pentium 4 or AMD equivalent processor Void Linux 10. Q4OS Q4OS is another Debian-based distribution that focuses on providing a minimal and fast desktop user experience. It also happens to be one of the best lightweight Linux distributions in our list. It features the Trinity desktop for its 32-bit edition and you can find KDE Plasma support on 64-bit version. Similar to Void Linux, Q4OS also runs on a bare minimum of at least 128 MB RAM and a 300 MHz CPU with a 3 GB storage space requirement. It should be more than enough for any vintage hardware. So, I\\u2019d say, you should definitely try it out! To know more about it, you can also check out our review of Q4OS. Minimum Requirements for Q4OS: RAM: 128 MB (Trinity Desktop) \\/ 1 GB (Plasma Desktop) CPU: 300 MHz (Trinity Desktop) \\/ 1 GHz (Plasma Desktop) Storage Space: 5 GB (Plasma Desktop) \\/ 3 GB (Trinity Desktop) Q4OS 11: MX Linux If you\\u2019ve got a slightly decent configuration (not completely vintage but old), MX Linux would be my personal recommendation for 32-bit systems. It also happens to be one of the best Linux distributions for every type of user. In general, MX Linux is a fantastic lightweight and customizable distribution based on Debian. You get the option to choose from KDE, XFCE or Fluxbox (which is their own desktop environment for older hardware). You can explore more about it on their official website and give it a try. Minimum System Requirements: 1 GB RAM (2 GB recommended for a comfortable usage) 15 GB of disk space (20 GB recommended). MX Linux 12. Linux Mint Debian Edition Linux Mint based on Debian? Why not? You get the same Cinnamon desktop experience just without Ubuntu as its base. It is equally easy to use and as reliable as Linux Mint based on Ubuntu. Not just limited to the Debian base, but you get support for both 64-bit and 32-bit systems. This should be a great choice if you do not want to use a Linux distribution that you\\u2019ve never heard on your 32-bit system. Minimum System Requirements: 1 GB RAM (2 GB recommended for a comfortable usage) 15 GB of disk space (20 GB recommended). Linux Mint Debian Edition 13. Sparky Linux Sparky Linux is one of the best lightweight Linux distributions tailored for beginners. It is easily customizable and light on resources. It offers different editions as per your requirements but it does support 32-bit versions. Considering that you want something for your old computer, I would recommend taking a look at its MinimalGUI edition unless you really need a full-fledged desktop environment like Xfce or LXQt. Minimum System Requirements: RAM: 512 MB CPU: Pentium 4, or AMD Athlon Disk space: 2 GB (CLI Edition), 10 GB (Home Edition), 20 GB (GameOver Edition) Sparky Linux 14. Mageia A fork of Mandriva Linux, Mageia Linux is a community-powered Linux distribution that supports 32-bit systems. Usually, you will notice a major release every year. They aim to contribute their work to give a free operating system which is also potentially secure. It may not be a popular choice for 32-bit systems but it supports a lot of desktop environments (like KDE Plasma, GNOME), you just need to install it from its repositories if you need. You should get the option to download a desktop environment specific image from their official site. Minimum System Requirements: 512 MB RAM (2 GB Recommended) 5 GB storage space for minimal installation (20 GB for regular installation) CPU: Pentium 4, or AMD Athlon Mageia Honorable Mentions: Funtoo & Puppy Linux Funtoo is a Gentoo-based community-developed Linux distribution. It focuses on giving you the best performance with Gentoo Linux along with some extra packages to make the experience complete for users. It is also interesting to note that the development is actually led by Gentoo Linux\\u2019s creator Daniel Robbins. Puppy Linux is a tiny Linux distro with almost no bundled software applications but the basic tools. If nothing else works and you want the lightest distro, Puppy Linux could be an option. Of course, if you\\u2019re new to Linux, you may not have the best experience with these options. But, both the distros support 32-bit systems and work well across many older Intel\\/AMD chipsets. Explore more about it on their official websites to explore. Funtoo Puppy Linux Wrapping Up I focused the list on Debian-based and some Independent distributions. However, if you don\\u2019t mind long term support and just want to get your hands on a 32-bit supported image, you can try any Ubuntu 18.04 based distributions (or any official flavour) as well. At the time of writing this, they just have a few more months of software support left. Hence, I avoided mentioning it as the primary options. But, if you like Ubuntu 18.04 based distros or any of its flavours, you do have options like LXLE, Linux Lite, Zorin Lite 15, and other official flavours. Even though most modern desktop operating systems based on Ubuntu have dropped support for 32-bit support. You still have plenty of choices to go with. What would you prefer to have on your 32-bit system?

System halted.\\u2018 Sometimes it is also shown \\u2018No Bootable Medium Found! System halted\\u2018. This error is more common when trying to start a new virtual machine, but it is not impossible to happen at an existing virtual machine if the virtual hard drive is missing. Note: This problem has to do purely with VirtualBox, and can be experienced on any host operating system be it Windows, Mac OS or Linux. What causes this \\u201cCould not read from the boot medium\\u201d error? There are two main reasons behind this issue: VirtualBox doesn\\u2019t point to an operating system, either a mounted iso or a virtual hard disk with a bootable OS. When you create a virtual machine for a first time, you need to mount a bootable iso like Ubuntu. If you mount a bootable iso before you start your virtual machine, you will be successful booting up the system. The CD\\/ DVD storage device controller is configured as SATA. Another issue can be appeared, if you mount accidentally the bootable iso to a SATA storage device controller instead of IDE. VirtualBox works without any problems when a SATA storage device points to a virtual hard drive, but this is not the case for a bootable iso. How to solve it? If you are not sure which of the 2 reasons apply to you, I can show you a solution that covers both, and finally stop receiving the error message. Step 1: Right click on the virtual machine that isn\\u2019t a bootable state and click on settings. Step 2: Once the settings menu is open, follow the steps access storage\",\"3813\":\"Comments\",\"2727\":null,\"2904\":\"K2 is the planet's most challenging mountain to climb. 10 climbers from Nepal have made history by summiting the World's second tallest peak during winter.

While privacy-aware and tech-savvy people were already aware of the existence of this awesome application, Signal got the much deserved fame after the latest WhatsApp privacy policy updates. Whatever maybe the reason if you are new to Signal and you are wondering if you can use Signal on desktop, the answer is yes. You can install Signal on Linux, Windows and macOS systems along with your smartphone. Signal Messenger on Pop OS Linux distribution I am not going to highlight the features Signal offers because you might already be aware of them. I am going to show you different methods of installing Signal application Linux desktop: Install Signal on Linux using Snap (snap applications take longer to load but get automatic update and hassle-free installation) Install Signal on Debian and Ubuntu-based distributions using apt (additional efforts in adding the repository but installed apps get automatic updates) Install Signal on Arch and Manjaro Linux using AUR Install Signal on Fedora and other Linux using Flatpak package You can choose one of the methods based on your distribution and preference: Method 1: Installing Signal on Ubuntu and other Linux using Snap If you are using Ubuntu, you can find Signal desktop app in Snap package format in the Software Center. Alternatively, you can use the Snap command to install Signal on any Linux distribution that has Snap support enabled. sudo snap install signal-desktop You can remove it using snap remove or from the Software Center. Some people do not like Snap packages because they take too long to start. The good news is that you can use apt command to install Signal. The next section discusses that. Method 2: Install Signal on Debian and Ubuntu-based distributions via APT (using official Signal repository) Here are the steps you have to follow to install Signal from its official repository on Debian, Debian, Linux Mint, elementary OS and other distributions based on Debian\\/Ubuntu. You can copy the commands and paste it in the terminal. First thing is to get the GPG key for the official Signal repository and add it to the trusted keys of your APT package manager. wget -O- https:\\/\\/updates.signal.org\\/desktop\\/apt\\/keys.asc | sudo apt-key add - With the key added, you can safely add the repository to your system. Don\\u2019t get alarmed with the use of xenial in the repository name. It will work with Ubuntu 18.04, 20.04 and newer version as well as Debian, Mint etc. echo \\\"deb [arch=amd64] https:\\/\\/updates.signal.org\\/desktop\\/apt xenial main\\\" | sudo tee -a \\/etc\\/apt\\/sources.list.d\\/signal-xenial.list Thanks to the tee command in Linux, you\\u2019ll have a new file signal-xenial.list in the sources.list directory \\/etc\\/apt\\/sources.list.d. This new file will have the Signal repository information i.e. deb [arch=amd64] https:\\/\\/updates.signal.org\\/desktop\\/apt xenial main. Now that you have added the repository, update the cache and install Signal desktop application: sudo apt update && sudo apt install signal-desktop Once installed, look for Signal in application menu and start it. Since you have added the repository, your installed Signal application will be automatically updated with the regular system updates. Enjoy encrypted messaging with Signal on your Linux desktop. Removing Signal The tutorial won\\u2019t be complete if I don\\u2019t share the removal steps with you. Let\\u2019s go through it. First, remove the application: sudo apt remove signal-desktop You may leave it as it is, or you may remove the Signal repository from your system. It\\u2019s optional and up to you. With the repository still in the system, you can install Signal again, easily. If you remove the repository, you\\u2019ll have to add it again following the steps in the previous section. If you want to remove the Signal repository as well, you can opt for the graphical method by going to Software and Updated tool and deleting it from there. Alternatively, you can remove the file with rm command: rm -i \\/etc\\/apt\\/sources.list.d\\/signal-xenial.list Method 3: Installing Signal on Arch and Manjaro from AUR Signal is available to install on Arch-based Linux distributions via AUR. If you are using Pamac on Manjaro and have enabled AUR, you should find Signal in the package manager. Otherwise, you can always use an AUR helper. sudo yay -Ss I believe you can delete Signal in the similar function. Method 4: Installing Signal on Fedora and other Linux using Flatpak There is no .rpm file for Signal. However, a Flatpak package is available, and you may use that to get Signal on Fedora. flatpak install flathub org.signal.Signal Once installed, you can run it from the menu or use the following command in the terminal: flatpak run org.signal.Signal Signal and Telegram are two mainstream and viable options to ditch WhatsApp. Both provide native Linux desktop applications. If you use Telegram, you can join the official It\\u2019s FOSS channel. I use Signal in individual capacity because it doesn\\u2019t have the \\u2018channel\\u2019 feature yet.\",\"874\":\"After you install Fedora, you may discover that some of the software that you want to install and use is not available in the software store. These packages may not be in the Fedora repos for several reasons. Don\\u2019t worry, I\\u2019ll tell you how to make them available by adding third party repos for Fedora. What are the third party repositories in Fedora? Operating system devs often make decisions on what packages can and cannot be available in their repos. Fedora is no different. According to the Fedora docs, third party repos contain packages that \\u201chave more liberal licensing policies and provide software packages that Fedora excludes for various reasons\\u201d. Fedora enforces the following guidelines when it comes to packages: If it is proprietary, it cannot be included in Fedora If it is legally encumbered, it cannot be included in Fedora If it violates United States laws (specifically, Federal or applicable state laws), it cannot be included in Fedora For this reason, there exists a couple of repositories that a user can add. This enables the user to get access to the additional software packages. Enabling RPM Fusion Repositories in Fedora RPM Fusion is the main source for third party applications for Fedora. RPM Fusion is the result of three projects (Dribble, Freshrpms, and Livna) merging. RPM Fusion offers two different software repos. The free repo contains open-source software. The nonfree repo contains software that does not have an open-source license, but the source code is freely available. There are two ways to enable RPM Fusion: from the terminal or by clicking a couple of buttons. We\\u2019ll take a look at each. Method 1: Command line method This is the easiest method to enable the RPM Fusion repos. Just enter the following command to enable both repos: sudo dnf install https:\\/\\/mirrors.rpmfusion.org\\/free\\/fedora\\/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm https:\\/\\/mirrors.rpmfusion.org\\/nonfree\\/fedora\\/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm You will be asked to enter your password. You will then be asked to verify that you want to install these repos. Once you approve it, the installation will be completed in a few seconds or minutes. Install RPM Fusion via command line Method 2: Graphical method To enable the RPM Fusion repos using this method, you need to visit the RPM Fusion Website. You will see links for both repos for different Fedora versions. RPM Fusion recommends installing the free repo first. So, click the link for the free repo for your version of Fedora. This will open a window asking if you want to install the repo. Click install. Install RPM Fusion via GUI Once the installation is completed, go back and install the nonfree repo using the same steps. Enable Fedora\\u2019s Third Party repositories Fedora recently started offering its own repo of third party apps. The number of applications available in this repo is very small. You can install Chrome browser on Fedora with it. Apart from Chrome, it also includes Adobe Brackets, Atom, Steam, Vivaldi, Opera, and more. Just like RPM Fusion, you can enable this repo via the terminal or graphically. Method 1: Command line method To enable Fedora\\u2019s third-party repo, enter the following command into your terminal: sudo dnf install fedora-workstation-repositories Be sure to ensure your password when prompted and type Y to approve the installation. Method 1: Graphical method If you are not comfortable using the terminal, you can use the graphical method. First, you need to open Gnome Software. Next, you need to click on the hamburger menu in the top right corner and select \\u201cSoftware Repositories\\u201d from the menu. Gnome Software Menu In the Software Repositories window, you will see a section at the top that says \\u201cThird Party Repositories\\u201d. Click the Install button. Enter your password when you are prompted and you are done. Fedora Third Party Repo installation With these additional repositories enabled, you can install software to your heart\\u2019s content. You can easily install them from the software center or using the DNF package manager.

I'm still a bit hesitant to actually go and get it done due to Covid and social distancing norms still not being followed. I'd like to hear any recent experiences at Aadhaar enrollment centers in the Bangalore area in general. Doing so might make me feel better about the entire process. If you could talk about whether your appointment was on time, how long it took, how crowded it was etc., that would be great. Thanks!

In fact, a lot of people use the Pi Zero in the final version of the project after prototyping on a different full-sized Pi board. And, that\\u2019s because it consumes much less power compared to the flagship Pi boards and makes it ideal to build battery powered gadgets. Preview Product Price CanaKit Raspberry Pi Zero W (Wireless) Complete Starter Kit - 16 GB Edition $32.99 Buy on Amazon After scouring Instructables, Reddit, Hackaday, other maker oriented communities and my own experience with Pi, I have compiled a list of projects built around the Raspberry Pi Zero and the Raspberry Pi Zero W. The community is extremely innovative and all these projects make impressive use of various features of this maker board. So, in addition to the awesome list of Raspberry Pi Projects that we covered earlier, here, we will be focusing on Raspberry Pi Zero! Top Creative Projects You Can Build With Raspberry Pi Zero Of course, you\\u2019re free to use some Raspberry Pi Zero alternatives and try the same project ideas mentioned below. 1. Portable Game Console This is by far my favorite project built around the Raspberry Pi Zero, hence featured at the top. Today we have emulators for most of the retro games. This project puts the Pi Zero in the classic game-boy form factor. You can play most of your favorite retro games and you can play them anywhere. This project is also beautifully documented in YouTube video(s) and on Instructables. Portable Game Console 2. DIY Smart Speaker Powered by Alexa Amazon\\u2019s Alexa has always been very tinkerer friendly and makers around the world have built all kinds of Alexa based devices. This project also adds RGB programmable LED\\u2019s to make it look a little more like the echo speaker. DIY Smart Speaker 3. Home Network Music System Getting a proper home music system setup is usually expensive. However, with the inexpensive Raspberry Pi Zero, you can utilize your MP3 collection to set up a home network music system. This project uses the PiDrive, PiDrive is basically a Raspberry Pi Zero W attached to a hard disk. Unfortunately, I think it has been discontinued but you can also build it using a normal Pi Zero W in different configurations. You can play local music or even stream from different services. Pi MusicBox 4. Network Ad Blocker using Pi-Hole This is something I personally use on a daily basis and it has completely changed my internet experience. If you\\u2019re someone who doesn\\u2019t want to see advertisements while you browse around online, an Ad blocker using Raspberry Pi would be exciting, right? Pi-Hole on a Raspberry Pi can block all the ads on your entire network. Anyone on the network with an active Pi-Hole will have an ad-free experience. It also speeds up your internet experience since the bandwidth used by ads is freed up. You can watch Linus\\u2019 video to get an idea or refer to the detailed post in Linus Tech Tips forums linked in the button below. Ad-Blocker using Pi Hole 5. AirPlay Speaker using Raspberry Pi Zero AirPlay is a chromecast equivalent in the Apple ecosystem, you can cast media from your Apple devices to an AirPlay supported speaker. This project is built very well with 3D printed parts and you can find detailed instructions for it. AirPlay Speaker 6. DIY Google Home with a Bluetooth Speaker This is another nifty little project which is a tinkerer\\u2019s dream. Building your own smart speaker powered by the Google Assistant? Indeed, exciting! Here, a Pi Zero is paired with a Bluetooth speaker, microphone and the Google Assistant SDK to achieve some functionalities. You can ask questions and do most of the things you can with the official Google Home device. This project does not handle the casting part of the Google Home experience though. DIY Google Home 7. Pedal Pi \\u2013 Raspberry Pi Zero Guitar Pedal Pedal Pi is a programmable Lo-Fi guitar pedal built using the Pi Zero where you can program your own custom effects. The project is fully open source (including the hardware) as well. It goes to prove how versatile the Pi Zero can be. It can be an incredibly fun experience for people who are makers and also into digital music. Pedal Pi 8. ZeroBot \\u2013 FPV Robot There are a lot of different robots you can build using the Pi Zero. It is almost perfect for any kind of robot that you can think of building. It has ample amount of GPIO, a decent processor, a camera interface and the choice of software stack and programming language. The ZeroBot is an FPV bot which also has a camera and is able to transmit what it is seeing. It even features a completely 3D printed body. You can find detailed instructions here. 9. WiFi Security Camera Raspberry Pi Zero W comes with a CSI connector where you can connect the camera module. This compatibility also lets you easily build a WiFi-powered CCTV camera(s) for your home at a very reasonable price compared to commercial products. The motionEyeOS is a purposely built to convert your SBC (in this case the Pi Zero) to a surveillance system. You can find more information in the video above or head to the link below. WiFi Security Camera 10. PIX-E GIF Camera GIF\\u2019s have taken over social media and all IM platforms. Just thinking of a dedicated GIF camera makes me chuckle.

This project has been documented really well with accompanying videos on Hackaday GIF Camera 11. Wearable Timelapse Camera One of the sleekest camera project I\\u2019ve seen, this is a wearable camera. You can take time-lapses, and videos from a first person\\u2019s perspective. This is a project by Adafruit and is documented really well. Refer to the video above to get an idea or head to the link below. Wearable Timelapse Camera 12. Telescope Camera Building a telescope camera is one of the most popular camera based applications for the Pi Zero. Makers around the world have taken amazing pictures with their DIY telescope cameras. Telescope Camera 13. Kodi on Pi Zero Kodi is one of the best open source media server software for making a media box for your TV. The amazing part is that it also runs on the Pi Zero W. Now you can DIY an alternative to the Amazon Fire TV Stick. Kodi on Pi Zero 14. OctoPrint \\u2013 Wireless 3D Printing If you are into 3D printing, you would have heard about OctoPrint at some point. OctoPrint unlocks many feature comforts we enjoy with normal printers like sending print jobs directly from the computer to the 3D printer instead of using a micro SD card. You can also attach a webcam and monitor your prints and control all aspects of the printer. OctoPrint is usually used with the bigger Pi\\u2019s but it can also be used with the Raspberry Pi Zero W with some soldering and mods. It is important to note that there is low WiFi interference when using the Pi Zero since it can impact prints. Here are some references talking about OctoPrint on Pi Zero to help you build it yourself: OctoPrint on Pi Zero OctoPrint on Pi Zero (from Prusa 3D) 15. Pirate Radio Station This seems like quite a fun idea, you can actually make the Pi Zero W broadcast using FM. It also happens to be a simple project and you don\\u2019t need many additional components either. You can be your own neighborhood RJ, do make sure to check out the legal aspects of a pirate radio station in your country. Pirate Radio Station 16. IoT Smart Alarm Clock Here\\u2019s a project making something which might sound very trivial but nevertheless is super cool and underrated.

You can find all the relevant details from the video above. 23. VPN Server In today\\u2019s world, extra care needs to be taken about companies barging into one\\u2019s privacy and using a VPN is becoming more and more commonplace. Fret not, you can utilize the Raspberry Pi Zero W with OpenVPN to add an extra layer of security to your home network. This can be a great for small families where everyone in the house can be protected and don\\u2019t need to separate VPN subscriptions. VPN Server 24. Weather Station This is a very cool project, a complete weather station which can display various weather metrics for the day and forecasts too. It even includes a 3D printed case which looks pretty sharp. The amazing part is that you can use the display to show things other than weather as well. As I also noticed in another similar project on Instructables, you may also tweak it with your own custom database and website. Weather Station 25. Ambient Lighting System for TV An ambient lighting system enhances the TV experience, this is another amazing project involving the Raspberry Pi Zero. In real life this effect feels like a dynamic portrait mode applied to the screen and whatever is being shown on the screen, makes the experience a lot immersive. GreatScott (a popular YouTuber) for content based around electronics and DIY shows you around with the project in the video above. You may also refer to the written instructions from the link below. Ambient Lighting System 26. Wireless Network Printer The Pi Zero W is a great board to make any old printer free from being fixed to one computer and have the freedom of placing it anywhere. This way print jobs can be sent from multiple computers, phones on the same network. This is a quality of life improvement which is highly underrated, even in households. This project utilizes CUPS running on Pi Zero W to make your printer wireless. Wireless Network Printer 27. Pi Zero Cluster You can pack in 10\\u2019s of these tiny computers together to have access to massive amounts of parallel processing. The GPU\\u2019s on these SBC\\u2019s can be utilized for challenging compute needs. Regular Raspberry Pi\\u2019s have long been used to make clusters and Raspberry Pi based super computers consisting of 100\\u2019s \\u2013 1000\\u2019s of Pi\\u2019s. Since the introduction of the Pi Zero with it\\u2019s lower price and size, it is possible to put more of them into a small space. There are many custom boards which are built to hold multiple Pi Zero\\u2019s. Pi Zero Cluster Closing Thoughts The projects featured here are only a tip of the iceberg. You can find many more projects if you look around on the internet.

The stability part of it is being jeopardized thanks to the latest changes made to this project by IBM-owned Red Hat. Here\\u2019s a quick summary: Focus shifts from CentOS Linux, the rebuild of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) to CentOS Stream, which tracks just ahead of a current RHEL release. CentOS Linux 8, as a rebuild of RHEL 8, will end at the end of 2021. After that, the rolling release CentOS Stream becomes the identity of CentOS project. There will be no CentOS 9 based on RHEL 9 in the future. CentOS Linux 7 will continue its lifecycle and will end in 2024. Let\\u2019s go in detail. Before CentOS Stream, learn a little background knowledge of Red Hat, CentOS and Fedora Let me explain it to those who are unaware. Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) is a commercial Linux distribution developed by Red Hat and it offers both servers and desktop editions. They have strict guidelines to protect Red Hat trademark. Red Hat has two main community projects on Linux distribution: Fedora and CentOS. Situation until now For years, Fedora worked as upstream for RHEL. This means that new features and changes get introduced in Fedora first and some of them get to be included in the next release of RHEL. In loose terms, Fedora works as testing ground for Red Hat. At least that\\u2019s what it used to be until a couple of years ago. CentOS, on the other hand, is\\/was a downstream community project. Whatever changes RHEL introduced also get to be included in CentOS. A new version of RHEL released? A new version of CentOS would follow a couple of months later. Basically, CentOS is a clone of RHEL with most of RHEL\\u2019s benefits but without RHEL\\u2019s cost. So far, it was regarded as the paying customers get the features first in RHEL and then the community users get them through CentOS. CentOS Stream: What started as an experiment, becomes the future In September 2019, Red Hat announced CentOS Stream. It is a rolling release version of CentOS. The idea was to use CentOS Stream as a midstream between the upstream development in Fedora and downstream development in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). So, Fedora is testing ground for the future major version release of RHEL and CentOS. At the same time, CentOS Stream clears the path to contribute to future minor release to RHEL and CentOS. Sounds like a good idea? It was until Red Hat announced that in the future CentOS will only exist as CentOS Stream. The latest stable release CentOS 8 suddenly has its life cut short to the end of 2021 instead of the earlier projected date of May 2029. The older CentOS 7 will still be supported till 2024. Do you see the problem with this change? You deployed CentOS 8 thinking that you\\u2019ll get a stable production server till 2029. Instead, it gets discontinued next year and you are forced choose between opting for CentOS Stream or replace it with other distributions like Debian or Ubuntu. This means while the paid RHEL users will enjoy the well-tested stable server, community members will have no option other than using a not-so-stable rolling release distribution. Trivia CentOS was not started by Red Hat. It was a community project since the beginning. After Red Hat started sponsoring the development, the trademark and ownership of CentOS was transferred to Red Hat in 2014, around 10 years after its creation. Corporate interference often spell doom As Nixcraft observes, when a big corporate enters the scene, it may not always bring good news. Community projects often take the hit. Oracle buys Sun: Solaris Unix, Sun servers\\/workstation, and MySQL went to \\/dev\\/null.

However, reading the JSON file can be a pain if the JSON file is minified. Take this for an example: Minified JSON is difficult to read A computer can easily read it. Even a human can still read it but if JSON file is properly formatted to display the content, it will be much easier. I mean JSON files are supposed to read like this after all: Pretty Printed JSON is easier to read You can use most text editor with some plugins to display it with proper formatting. However, if you are stuck to a terminal or if you want to do it in your shell script, things will be different. If you got a minified file, let me show you how to pretty print the JSON file in Linux terminal. Pretty print JSON with jq command in Linux jq is a command line JSON processor. You can use it to slice, filter, map and transform structured data. I am not going in details about using jq command line tool here. To use jq, you need to install it first. You can use your distribution\\u2019s package manager to install it. With universe repository enabled, you can install it on Ubuntu using the apt command: sudo apt install jq Once you have it installed, use it in the following manner to pretty print JSON file on the display: jq . sample.json Pretty printed JSON file You may also tempt to use cat but I believe it one of the useless use of cat command. cat sample.json | jq Keep in mind that the above command will not impact the original JSON file.

You probably also know that you cannot redirect to the same file and the tee command is not guaranteed to work all the time.

You have to accept that or stop using WhatsApp altogether. Privacy cautious people had seen it coming a long time ago. After all, Facebook paid $19 billion to buy a mobile app like WhatsApp that hardly made any money at that time. Now it\\u2019s time for Facebook to get the return on its $19 billion investment. They will share your data with advertisers so that you get more personalized (read invasive) ads. If you are fed up with the \\u201cmy way or highway\\u201d attitude of the big tech like Facebook, Google, Twitter, perhaps you may try some alternative social media platforms. These alternative social platforms are open source, use a decentralized approach with P2P or Blockchain technologies, and you may be able to self-host some of them. Open source and decentralized social networks Image Credit: Datonel on DeviantArt I\\u2019ll be honest with you here. These alternative platforms may not give you the same kind of experience you are accustomed to, but these platforms would not infringe on your privacy and freedom of speech. That\\u2019s a trade off. 1. Minds Alternative to: Facebook and YouTube Features: Open Source code base, Blockchain Self-host: No On Minds, you can post videos, blogs, images and set statuses. You can also message and video chat securely with groups or directly with friends. Trending feeds and hashtags allows you to discover articles of your interest. That\\u2019s not it. You also have the option to earn tokens for your contributions. These tokens can be used to upgrade your channel. Creators can receive direct payments in USD, Bitcoin and Ether from fans. Minds 2. Aether Alternative to: Reddit Features: Open Source, P2P Self-host: No Aether is an open source, P2P platform for self-governing communities with auditable moderation and mod elections. The content on Aether is ephemeral in nature and it is kept only for six months unless someone saves it. Since it is P2P, there is no centralized servers. An interesting feature of Aether is its democratic communities. Communities elect mods and can impeach them by votes. Aether 3. Mastodon Alternative to: Twitter Features: Open Source, Decentralized Self-host: Yes Mastodon is already known among FOSS enthusiasts. We have covered Mastodon as an open source Twitter alternative in the past, and we also have a profile on Mastodon. Mastodon isn\\u2019t a single website like Twitter, it\\u2019s a network of thousands of communities operated by different organizations and individuals that provide a seamless social media experience. You can host your own Mastodon instance and choose to connect it with other Mastodon instances or you simply join one of the existing Mastodon instances like Mastodon Social. Mastodon 4. LBRY Alternative to: YouTube Features: Open Source, Decentralized, Blockchain Self-host: No At the core, LBRY is a blockchain based decentralization protocol. On top of that protocol, you get a digital marketplace powered by its own cryptocurrency. Though LBRY allows creators to offer l kind of digital content like movies, books and games, it is essentially promoted as an YouTube alternative. You can access the video sharing platform on Odysee. We have covered LBRY on It\\u2019s FOSS in the past and you may read that for more details. If you are joining LBRY, don\\u2019t forget to follow It\\u2019s FOSS there. LBRY 5. KARMA Alternative to: Instagram Features: Decentralized, Blockchain Self-host: No Here\\u2019s another blockchain based social network governed by cryptocurrency. KARMA is an Instagram clone built on top of open source blockchain platform, EOSIO. Every like and share your content gets, earns you KARMA tokens. You can use these tokens to boost your content or convert it to real money through one of the partner crypto exchanges. KARMA is a mobile only app and available on Play Store and App Store. KARMA 6. Peertube Alternative to: YouTube Features: Decentralized, P2P Self-host: Yes Developed by French company Framasoft, PeerTube is a decentralized video streaming platform. PeerTube uses the BitTorrent protocol to share bandwidth between users. PeerTube aims to resist corporate monopoly. It does not rely on ads and does not track you. Keep in mind that your IP address is not anonymous here. There are various instances of PeerTube available where you can host your videos or you host it yourself. Some instances may charge money while most are free. PeerTube 7. Diaspora Alternative to: Facebook Features: Decentralized, Open Source Self-host: Yes Diaspora was one of the earliest decentralized social networks. This was back in 2010 and Diaspora was touted as a Facebook alternative. It did get some deserving limelight in its initial years but it got confined to only a handful of niche members. Similar to Mastodon, Diaspora is composed of pods. You can register with a pod or host your own pod. The Big Tech doesn\\u2019t own your data, you do. Diaspora 8. Dtube Alternative to: YouTube Features: Decentralized, Blockchain Self-host: No Dtube is a blockhain based decentralized YouTube clone. I use the word YouTube clone because the interface is way too similar to YouTube. Like most other blockchain based social networks, Dtube is governed by DTube Coins (DTC) that creator earns when someone watches or interact with their content. The coins can be used to promote the content or cashed out from partner crypto exhcnages. DTube 9. Signal Alternative to: WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger Features: Open Source Self-host: No Unlike the end to end encrypted chats in WhatsApp, Signal doesn\\u2019t track you, share your data and invade your privacy. Signal rose to fame when Edward Snowden endorsed it. It got even more famous when Elon Musk tweeted about it after WhatsApp sharing user data with Facebook. Signal uses its own open source Signal protocol to give you end-to-end encrypted messages and calls. Signal What else? There are some other platforms that are not open source or decentralized, but they respect your privacy and free speech. MeWe: Alternative to Facebook Voice: Alternative to Medium ProtonMail: Alternative to Gmail There is also Element messenger based on Matrix protocol which you may try. I know there are probably several other such alternative social media platforms. Care to share them? I might add them to this list. If you had to choose one of the platforms from the list, which one would you choose?\",\"783\":\"\\u092a\\u094d\\u0930\\u0927\\u093e\\u0928\\u092e\\u0902\\u0924\\u094d\\u0930\\u0940 \\u092e\\u094b\\u0926\\u0940 \\u0915\\u094b \\u0938\\u094b\\u092e\\u0928\\u093e\\u0925 \\u091f\\u094d\\u0930\\u0938\\u094d\\u091f \\u0915\\u093e \\u0905\\u0917\\u0932\\u093e \\u0905\\u0927\\u094d\\u092f\\u0915\\u094d\\u0937 \\u091a\\u0941\\u0928\\u093e \\u0917\\u092f\\u093e\",\"3827\":\"Comments\",\"5010\":\"Comments\",\"538\":\"Navy Chief Admiral Karambir Singh's address on the occasion of Armed Forces Veterans Day\",\"743\":\"Today is a landmark day for two of Gujarat\\u2019s leading urban centres.

Why? Because privacy. Privacy is no longer a luxury. It has become the basic necessity. Privacy-oriented niche devices like Librem notebook series offer hardware kill switches to block webcam, microphone, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. Dell will also be providing hardware kill switches in 2021 in the form of keyboard combination. It is implementing kill switch at kernel level and thus allowing you to disable webcam and microphone with keyboard shortcut. Dell is adding hardware privacy driver to Linux kernel In a patch to Linux kernel, Dell disclosed its privacy driver that protects users privacy of audio and camera from hardware level. Once the audio or camera privacy mode enabled, any applications will not get any audio or video stream. With Ctrl+F4 hotkey, audio privacy mode will be enabled and camera mute hotkey is Ctrl+F9. Why is it important? Is Linux so unsecure that anyone can use your webcam remotely? That\\u2019s the obvious question and I would like to clear a few things on this topic. We live in a connected world using internet extensively by means of a number of applications. While your operating system may be secure at the core, there can be some level of intrusion at application level. Browser extensions are being used for stealing data. Imagine a rogue browser extension with access to your webcam or microphone? This is why snapping the access to webcam, microphone etc at hardware level is a better option. The new privacy drivers from Dell provide this feature. As Phoronix noted, there is also indication that Dell is working on \\u2018privacy screen\\u2019 under the privacy driver. Privacy screen reduces the horizontal\\/vertical viewing angles of the display so that onlookers cannot clearly see the content on your screen. When will Dell Privacy Driver be available? Will it be for everyone? There is no timeline for now since the things are under development. Keep in mind that this is a Dell specific solution and they will be introducing this in their newer models in 2021. Though I think it should be available for any Dell device because it is included in the Linux kernel but I cannot confirm that. What if you want to ensure your privacy right now? If you got intrigued and want to ensure your privacy by disabling the webcam, microphone, screen etc, you don\\u2019t necessarily need to buy new Dell machines. There are additional accessories available that help you in this regard. For webcams, you may use external accessories like a webcam blocker with slider. I have one from Free Software Foundation when I opted for their annual membership. You can easily order one from Amazon or other e-commerce sites in your country. Preview Product Price Laptop Camera Cover Slide, Anti-spy Webcam Cover for Laptop, PC,... $5.99 Buy on Amazon There are similar devices for blocking microphones as well. I have never used them, so I CANNOT vouch for their effectiveness. Preview Product Price Mic-Lock Microphone Blocker (3 Pack) \\u2013 Signal Blocking Device (3.5mm) for Laptops, Smartphones,... $16.99 Buy on Amazon You may also use privacy screen filters that disables viewing angles so that people cannot peep on what you are doing on your laptop in public places like caf\\u00e9s, airports etc. I have seen people using it in tech conferences and it works pretty nicely. Preview Product Price Amazon Basics Privacy Screen Filter for 14 Inch 16:9 Widescreen Monitor $23.67 Buy on Amazon Overall, it is nice to see that big manufacturers like Dell are taking privacy seriously.

I struggle with insecurity, anxiety, self confidence. I got in touch with a therapist recently. In general I hate talking about my feelings or thoughts or really don't know how to talk about them so I always put up a happy face. The therapist asked me about what's bothering me and I obviously just told recent events that made me think I need to see someone. It seemed like they only counseled me on how to deal with those but didn't try to get to the root of my problems and didn't ask me for a follow up or to connect with them again. So we never even got to the root of my problems and I don't feel any better. From what I've read on various posts, it takes multiple sessions and a lot of talking to finally be able to help. Im not sure if the therapist didn't work for me or this is how it's supposed to be. What sort of experiences have you had with therapists? How did it work for you? And incase you can suggest a therapist who could help me it would be great.

Learn to use apt-cache command in this tutorial. What is apt-cache command used for? The apt package manager works on a local cache of package metadata. The metadata usually consists information like package name, version, description, dependencies, its repository and developers. With the apt-cache command, you can query this local APT cache and get relevant information. You can search for the availability of a package, its version number, its dependencies among other things. I\\u2019ll show you how to use the apt-cache command with examples. The location of APT cache is \\/var\\/lib\\/apt\\/lists\\/ directory. Which repository metadata to cache depends on the repositories added in your source list in the \\/etc\\/apt\\/sources.list file and additional repository files located in ls \\/etc\\/apt\\/sources.list.d directory. Surprisingly, apt-cache doesn\\u2019t clear the APT cache. For that you\\u2019ll have to use the apt-get clean command. Needless to say, the APT packaging system is used on Debian and Debian-based Linux distributions like Ubuntu, Linux Mint, elementary OS etc. You cannot use it on Arch or Fedora. Using apt-cache command Like any other Linux command, there are several options available with apt-cache and you can always refer to its man page to read about them. However, you probably won\\u2019t need to use all of them. This is why I am going to show you only the most common and useful examples of the apt-cache command in this tutorial. Always update It is always a good idea to update the local APT cache to sync it with the remote repositories. How do you do that? You use the command: sudo apt update Search for packages The most common use of apt-cache command is for finding package. You can use a regex pattern to search for a package in the local APT cache. apt-cache search package_name By default, it looks for the search term in both the name and description of the package. It shows the matching package along with its short description in alphabetical order. You can narrow down your search to look for the search term in package names only. apt-cache search --names-only package_name If you want complete details of all the matched packages, you may use the --full flag. It can also be used with --names-only flag. Get detailed package information If you know the exact package name (or if you have manged to find it with the search), you can get the detailed metadata information on the package. apt-cache show package_name You can see all kind of details in the package metadata like name, version, developer, maintainer, repository, short and long description, package size and even checksum. There is another option showpkg that displays information about the package name, version and its forward and reverse dependencies. apt-cache showpkg package_name apt-cache policy This is one of the rarely used option of apt-cache command. The policy options helps you debug the issue related to the preference file. If you specify the package name, it will show whether the package is installed, which version is available from which repository and its priority. By default, each installed package version has a priority of 100 and a non-installed package has a priority of 500. The same package may have more than one version with a different priority. APT installs the version with higher priority unless the installed version is newer. If this doesn\\u2019t make sense, it\\u2019s okay. It will be extremely rare for a regular Linux user to dwell this deep into package management. Check dependencies and reverse dependencies of a package You can check the dependencies of a package before (or even after) installing it. It also shows all the possible packages that can fulfill the dependency. apt-cache depends package You may also check which packages are dependent on a certain package by checking the reverse dependencies with apt-cahce. Frankly, I was also surprised to see that a DevOps tool like Ansible has a dependency on a funny Linux command like Cowsay. I think it\\u2019s perhaps because after installing Ansible, it displays some message on the nodes. Check unmet dependencies You may get troubled with unmet dependencies issue in Ubuntu or other Linux. The apt-cache command provides option to check all the unmet dependencies of various available packages on your system. apt-cache unmet Conclusion You can list all available packages with the apt-cache command. The output would be huge, so I suggest combining it with wc command to get a total number of available packages like this: apt-cache pkgnames | wc -l Did you notice that you don\\u2019t need to be root user for using apt-cache command? The newer apt command has a few options available to match the features of apt-cache command. Since apt is new, apt-get and its associated commands like apt-cache are still preferred to be used in scripts. I hope you find this tutorial helpful. If you have questions about any point discussed above or suggestion to improve it, please let me know in the comments.\",\"803\":\"Comments\",\"3222\":\"Thanks to CalDigit for sponsoring this video!

In a surprising development leaked to us from an unknown source, we have learned that a website is offering our digital assets for purchase at as little as 10cents to a growing community of over 900 thousand users since November. Fifteen thousand are joining them every day in what could be the biggest property grab in recent history. The site, called Earth2.io lets users buy the rights to control areas of Bangladesh cyber space, prompting questions of security and sovereignty. Developers of the site have tried to keep the project under wraps as the explosion in popularity has crashed servers around the world.
