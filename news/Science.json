Follow up video on QM of molecules here: https:\\/\\/youtu.be\\/azI-_S6g8C8 When Ernest Rutherford realized that atoms have a heavy nucleus, he hypothesized that the way the moon orbits earth is the same as the way an electron orbits the nucleus of atoms. We now know an atom would not look anything like this. So what does an atom really look like? Why are atoms so small? Why doesn\\u2019t an electron fall onto the proton in the nucleus if they attract each other? Why can\\u2019t you squeeze an atom, if it is mostly empty space? It turns out it is not mostly empty space. And you may be shocked at what it is actually filled with. The answers lie in the equations of quantum mechanics. One big problem with the Rutherford model is that when electrons are accelerated, as they would be in circular orbits, they create electromagnetic waves. This means that photons would be constantly radiated from the electron, causing it to lose energy. So using classical laws for the atom just did not work. In 1900, Max Planck showed that matter emitted only discrete amounts of radiation, with energy E proportional to the frequency f \\u2013 the proportionality constant h, being Planck\\u2019s constant. Neil\\u2019s Bohr combined Rutherford\\u2019s model and Planck\\u2019s theory to hypothesize that the electron could exist in certain special orbits without radiating energy. Planck\\u2019s constant had units of angular momentum. So he hypothesized that only those orbits would be allowed where the angular momentum of the electron is quantized. He guessed that the lowest orbit would have the momentum h\\/2pi where the 2pi comes from the geometry of circular orbits. And any orbit could exist as long as it was an integer multiple of this number. But Bohr could not explain why these special orbits should exist in the first place. French scientist, Louis de Broglie said if a particle has a momentum and a wavelength, then an electron is a wave. This required a huge philosophical leap, because he was said solid matter was composed of waves. DeBroglie suggested that electrons can only exist in orbits where their waves interfere constructively, and that can only happen if the circumference of the orbit is equal to any integer times the wavelength. This explained why orbits would be at the radii that they are, something that Bohr could not do. What is the nature of these waves? This puzzle was solved by Austrian physicist, Erwin Schrodinger. He said a wave can exist anywhere in 3D space, and formulated the rules to describe these waves in the Schrodinger equation. This equation could described the hydrogen atom with more detail and precision than the Bohr model, as well as all the other atoms in the periodic table. This was a new kind of mechanics - quantum mechanics. Why can't we just look inside any material to see what atoms look like? The problem is that in order to be seen, the object has to be large enough to reflect light. But the largest atom is 1000 times smaller than a wavelength of visible light. So visible light just goes right through the atoms. So we have to guess based on what the wave equation tells us. It tells us is that the electron forms a cloud around the nucleus. The shape of the cloud is governed by the wave function. The cloud represents the probable position of the electron if you were to measure it. The volume of the atom is thus not empty. It is filled everywhere with a cloud of electrons. We can use the Schrodinger wave equation to find the electron probability. The highest probability occurs at 0.529 X 10^-10 meters, which is exactly the same radius calculated by Bohr. So the most probable radius obtained from quantum mechanics is identical to the radius calculated by classical mechanics. In Bohr\\u2019s model, the electron was assumed to be at this distance all the time, but in the Schr\\u00f6dinger model, it is never at any one radius. It has only the highest probability of being at this radius. The difference is due to the uncertainty principle, and the wave function. And the same wave equation tells us that the nucleus of atoms is also a cloud. But the proton cloud is much smaller than the electron cloud because it is much more massive. There are other shapes that the cloud of the hydrogen atoms could take as well, depending on the energy level and quantum state of the electron. #whatdoatomslooklike #atomicmodel #quantummechanics Why doesn\\u2019t the electron crash into the proton in the nucleus? Even if you drop an electron directly onto a proton, the electron will not fall and hit the proton - Because it would violate the Heisenberg uncertainty equation - both delta X and delta P would be zero. This can't be. Why can\\u2019t I squeeze two atoms together? It would require too much energy.

Just ask Benson Farb. \\u201cThe hard part about math is that you\\u2019re failing 90% of the time, and you have to be the kind of person who can fail 90% of the time,\\u201d Farb once said at a dinner party. When another guest, also a mathematician, expressed amazement that he succeeded 10% of the time, he quickly admitted, \\u201cNo, no, no, I was exaggerating my success rate. Greatly.\\u201d Farb, a topologist at the University of Chicago, couldn\\u2019t be happier about his latest failure \\u2014 though, to be fair, it isn\\u2019t his alone. It revolves around a problem that, curiously, is both solved and unsolved, closed and open. The problem was the 13th of 23 then-unsolved math problems that the German mathematician David Hilbert, at the turn of the 20th century, predicted would shape the future of the field. The problem asks a question about solving seventh-degree polynomial equations. The term \\u201cpolynomial\\u201d means a string of mathematical terms \\u2014 each composed of numerical coefficients and variables raised to powers \\u2014 connected by means of addition and subtraction. \\u201cSeventh-degree\\u201d means that the largest exponent in the string is 7. Mathematicians already have slick and efficient recipes for solving equations of second, third, and to an extent fourth degree. These formulas \\u2014 like the familiar quadratic formula for degree 2 \\u2014 involve algebraic operations, meaning only arithmetic and radicals (square roots, for example). But the higher the exponent, the thornier the equation becomes, and solving it approaches impossibility. Hilbert\\u2019s 13th problem asks whether seventh-degree equations can be solved using a composition of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division plus algebraic functions of two variables, tops. The answer is probably no. But to Farb, the question is not just about solving a complicated type of algebraic equation. Hilbert\\u2019s 13th is one of the most fundamental open problems in math, he said, because it provokes deep questions: How complicated are polynomials, and how do we measure that? \\u201cA huge swath of modern mathematics was invented in order to understand the roots of polynomials,\\u201d Farb said. The problem has led him and the mathematician Jesse Wolfson at the University of California, Irvine into a mathematical rabbit hole, whose tunnels they\\u2019re still exploring. They\\u2019ve also drafted Mark Kisin, a number theorist at Harvard University and an old friend of Farb\\u2019s, to help them excavate. They still haven\\u2019t solved Hilbert\\u2019s 13th problem and probably aren\\u2019t even close, Farb admitted. But they have unearthed mathematical strategies that had practically disappeared, and they have explored connections between the problem and a variety of fields including complex analysis, topology, number theory, representation theory and algebraic geometry. In doing so, they\\u2019ve made inroads of their own, especially in connecting polynomials to geometry and narrowing the field of possible answers to Hilbert\\u2019s question. Their work also suggests a way to classify polynomials using metrics of complexity \\u2014 analogous to the complexity classes associated with the unsolved P vs. NP problem. \\u201cThey\\u2019ve really managed to extract from the question a more interesting version\\u201d than ones previously studied, said Daniel Litt, a mathematician at the University of Georgia. \\u201cThey\\u2019re making the mathematics community aware of many natural and interesting questions.\\u201d Open and Shut, and Open Again Many mathematicians already thought the problem was solved. That\\u2019s because a Soviet prodigy named Vladimir Arnold and his mentor, Andrey Nikolyevich Kolmogorov, published proofs of it in the late 1950s. For most mathematicians, the Arnold-Kolmogorov work closed the book. Even Wikipedia \\u2014 not a definitive source, but a reasonable proxy for public knowledge \\u2014 until recently declared the case closed. But five years ago, Farb came across a few tantalizing lines in an essay by Arnold, in which the famous mathematician reflected on his work and career. Farb was surprised to see that Arnold described Hilbert\\u2019s 13th problem as open and had actually spent four decades trying to solve the problem that he\\u2019d supposedly already conquered. \\u201cThere are all these papers that would just literally repeat that it was solved. They clearly had no understanding of the actual problem,\\u201d Farb said. He was already working with Wolfson, then a postdoctoral researcher, on a topology project, and when he shared what he\\u2019d found in Arnold\\u2019s paper, Wolfson jumped in. In 2017, during a seminar celebrating Farb\\u2019s 50th birthday, Kisin listened to Wolfson\\u2019s talk and realized with surprise that their ideas about polynomials were related to questions in his own work in number theory. He joined the collaboration. The reason for the confusion about the problem soon became clear: Kolmogorov and Arnold had solved only a variant of the problem. Their solution involved what mathematicians call continuous functions, which are functions without abrupt discontinuities, or cusps. They include familiar operations like sine, cosine and exponential functions, as well as more exotic ones. But researchers disagree on whether Hilbert was interested in this approach. \\u201cMany mathematicians believe that Hilbert really meant algebraic functions, not continuous functions,\\u201d said Zinovy Reichstein, a mathematician at the University of British Columbia. Farb and Wolfson have been working on the problem they believe Hilbert intended ever since their discovery. Hilbert\\u2019s 13th, Farb said, is a kaleidoscope. \\u201cYou open this thing up, and the more you put into it, the more new directions and ideas you get,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt cracks open the door to a whole array, this whole beautiful web of math.\\u201d The Roots of the Matter Mathematicians have been probing polynomials for as long as math has been around. Stone tablets carved more than 3,000 years ago show that ancient Babylonian mathematicians used a formula to solve polynomials of second degree \\u2014 a cuneiform forebear of the same quadratic formula that algebra students learn today. That formula, $latex{x=\\\\frac{{ \\u2013 b \\\\pm \\\\sqrt {b^2 \\u2013 4ac} }}{{2a}}}$, tells you how to find the roots, or the values of x that make an expression equal to zero, of the second-degree polynomial $latex{ax^2 + bx +c}$. Over time, mathematicians naturally wondered if such clean formulas existed for higher-degree polynomials. \\u201cThe multi-millennial history of this problem is to get back to something that powerful and simple and effective,\\u201d said Wolfson. The higher polynomials grow in degree, the more unwieldy they become. In his 1545 book Ars Magna, the Italian polymath Gerolamo Cardano published formulas for finding the roots of cubic (third-degree) and quartic (fourth-degree) polynomials. The roots of a cubic polynomial written $latex{ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0}$ can be found using this formula: The quartic formula is even worse. \\u201cAs they go up in degree, they go up in complexity; they form a tower of complexities,\\u201d said Curt McMullen of Harvard. \\u201cHow can we capture that tower of complexities?\\u201d The Italian mathematician Paolo Ruffini argued in 1799 that polynomials of degree 5 or higher couldn\\u2019t be solved using arithmetic and radicals; the Norwegian Niels Henrik Abel proved it in 1824. In other words, there can be no similar \\u201cquintic formula.\\u201d Fortunately, other ideas emerged that suggested ways forward for higher-degree polynomials, which could be simplified through substitution. For example, in 1786, a Swedish lawyer named Erland Bring showed that any quintic polynomial equation of the form $latex{ax^5 + bx^4 + cx^3 + dx^2 + ex + f = 0}$ could be retooled as $latex{px^5 + qx + 1 = 0}$ (where p and q are complex numbers determined by a, b, c, d, e and f). This pointed to new ways of approaching the inherent but hidden rules of polynomials. In the 19th century, William Rowan Hamilton picked up where Bring and others had left off. He showed, among other things, that to find the roots of any sixth-degree polynomial equation, you only need the usual arithmetic operations, some square and cube roots, and an algebraic formula that depends on only two parameters. In 1975, the American algebraist Richard Brauer at Harvard introduced the idea of \\u201cresolvent degree,\\u201d which describes the lowest number of terms needed to represent the polynomial of some degree. (Less than a year later, Arnold and Japanese number theorist Goro Shimura introduced nearly the same definition in another paper.) In Brauer\\u2019s framework, which represented the first attempt to codify the rules of such substitutions, Hilbert\\u2019s 13th problem asks us if it\\u2019s possible for seventh-degree polynomials to have a resolvent degree of less than 3; later, he made similar conjectures about sixth- and eighth-degree polynomials. But these questions also invoke a broader one: What\\u2019s the smallest number of parameters you need to find the roots of any polynomial? How low can you go? Thinking Visually A natural way to approach this question is to think about what polynomials look like. A polynomial can be written as a function \\u2014 $latex{f(x)=x^2 -3x + 1}$, for example \\u2014 and that function can be graphed. Then finding the roots becomes a matter of recognizing that where the function has value 0, the curve crosses the x-axis. Higher-degree polynomials give rise to more complicated figures. Third-degree polynomial functions with three variables, for example, produce smooth but twisty surfaces embedded in three dimensions. And again, by knowing where to look on these figures, mathematicians can learn more about their underlying polynomial structure. As a result, many efforts to understand polynomials borrow from algebraic geometry and topology, mathematical fields that focus on what happens when shapes and figures are projected, deformed, squashed, stretched or otherwise transformed without breaking. \\u201cHenri Poincar\\u00e9 basically invented the field of topology, and he explicitly said he was doing it in order to understand algebraic functions,\\u201d said Farb. \\u201cAt the time, people were really wrestling with these fundamental connections.\\u201d Hilbert himself unearthed a particularly remarkable connection by applying geometry to the problem. By the time he enumerated his problems in 1900, mathematicians had a vast array of tricks to reduce polynomials, but they still couldn\\u2019t make progress. In 1927, however, Hilbert described a new trick. He began by identifying all the possible ways to simplify ninth-degree polynomials, and he found within them a family of special cubic surfaces. Hilbert already knew that every smooth cubic surface \\u2014 a twisty shape defined by third-degree polynomials \\u2014 contains exactly 27 straight lines, no matter how tangled it appears. (Those lines shift as the coefficients of the polynomials change.) He realized that if he knew one of those lines, he could simplify the ninth-degree polynomial to find its roots. The formula required only four parameters; in modern terms, that means the resolvent degree is at most 4. \\u201cHilbert\\u2019s amazing insight was that this miracle of geometry \\u2014 from a completely different world \\u2014 could be leveraged to reduce the to 4,\\u201d Farb said. Toward a Web of Connections As Kisin helped Farb and Wolfson connect the dots, they realized that the widespread assumption that Hilbert\\u2019s 13th was solved had essentially closed off interest in a geometric approach to resolvent degree. In January 2020, Wolfson published a paper reviving the idea by extending Hilbert\\u2019s geometric work on ninth-degree polynomials to a more general theory. Hilbert had focused on cubic surfaces to solve ninth-degree polynomials in one variable. But what about higher-degree polynomials? To solve those in a similar way, Wolfson thought, you could replace that cubic surface with some higher-dimensional \\u201chypersurface\\u201d formed by those higher-degree polynomials in many variables. The geometry of these is less understood, but in the last few decades mathematicians have been able to prove that hypersurfaces always have lines in some cases. Hilbert\\u2019s idea of using a line on a cubic surface to solve a ninth-degree polynomial can be extended to lines on these higher-dimensional hypersurfaces. Wolfson used this method to find new, simpler formulas for polynomials for certain degrees. That means that even if you can\\u2019t visualize it, you can solve a 100-degree polynomial \\u201csimply\\u201d by finding a plane on a multidimensional cubic hypersurface (47 dimensions, in this case). With this new method, Wolfson confirmed Hilbert\\u2019s value of the resolvent degree for ninth-degree polynomials. And for other degrees of polynomials \\u2014 especially those above degree 9 \\u2014 his method narrows down the possible values for the resolvent degree. Thus, this isn\\u2019t a direct attack on Hilbert\\u2019s 13th, but rather on polynomials in general. \\u201cThey kind of found some adjacent questions and made progress on those, some of them long-standing, in the hopes that that will shed light on the original question,\\u201d McMullen said. And their work points to new ways of thinking about these mathematical constructions. This general theory of resolvent degree also shows that Hilbert\\u2019s conjectures about sixth-degree, seventh-degree and eighth-degree equations are equivalent to problems in other, seemingly unrelated fields of math. Resolvent degree, Farb said, offers a way to categorize these problems by a kind of algebraic complexity, rather like grouping optimization problems in complexity classes. Even though the theory began with Hilbert\\u2019s 13th, however, mathematicians are skeptical that it can actually settle the open question about seventh-degree polynomials. It speaks to big, unexplored mathematical landscapes in unimaginable dimensions \\u2014 but it hits a brick wall at the lower numbers, and it can\\u2019t determine their resolvent degrees. For McMullen, the lack of headway \\u2014 despite these signs of progress \\u2014 is itself interesting, as it suggests that the problem holds secrets that modern math simply can\\u2019t comprehend. \\u201cWe haven\\u2019t been able to address this fundamental problem; that means there\\u2019s some dark area we haven\\u2019t pushed into,\\u201d he said. \\u201cSolving it would require entirely new ideas,\\u201d said Reichstein, who has developed his own new ideas about simplifying polynomials using a concept he calls essential dimension. \\u201cThere is no way of knowing where they will come from.\\u201d But the trio is undeterred. \\u201cI\\u2019m not going to give up on this,\\u201d Farb said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s definitely become kind of the white whale. What keeps me going is this web of connections, the mathematics surrounding it.\\u201d\",\"1044\":\"In 2015 astronomers successfully predicted the appearance of a supernova within a couple weeks.

It resembled \\u201ca delicate cornucopia,\\u201d he wrote, one woven from \\u201cstiff, glistening, elastic threads, resembling the finest hairs of spun glass.\\u201d The skeleton is indeed made of glass, which the animal, Euplectella aspergillum \\u2014 nicknamed \\u201cVenus\\u2019 flower basket,\\u201d \\u2014 creates using acid extracted from seawater. Scientists still marvel at this sponge 180 years later. Its notable properties include stunning longevity \\u2014 some glass sponges are thought to live many thousands of years, placing them among the longest-lived animals \\u2014 and the ability to channel light through its silica strands in the manner of fiber optics. For the last two decades, a group of biologists, materials scientists and engineers at Harvard University has focused on the feature of Venus\\u2019 flower basket that attracted Owen: the intricate design of its glass skeleton. Their recent work reveals that the skeleton is, for unknown reasons, exceptionally strong \\u2014 nearly as uncrushable as possible for this kind of structure. \\u201cIt\\u2019s sort of the holy grail of engineering design,\\u201d said Dhruv Bhate, an associate professor of engineering at Arizona State University who studies the Venus\\u2019 flower basket but is not involved in the work of the Harvard team. The skeleton\\u2019s strength derives from its peculiar lattice pattern, which first intrigued the Harvard materials scientist and chemist Joanna Aizenberg about 20 years ago. Katia Bertoldi, one of Aizenberg\\u2019s co-authors on the recent studies, was also captivated by the lattice pattern as soon as she saw it. \\u201cIt\\u2019s this periodic architecture, but it\\u2019s not a simple one,\\u201d Bertoldi said. She and her colleagues wondered, \\u201cWhy this particular architecture?\\u201d They noted that the glass beams that form the skeleton of the Venus\\u2019 flower basket have a lot in common with trusses, the assemblages of beams used to stabilize bridges and skyscrapers. For well over a century, engineers\\u2019 preferred design for trusses has been a sturdy lattice consisting of a square grid with diagonals running in both directions for added support. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve been doing this the same way for a long, long time,\\u201d said Matheus Fernandes, a graduate student on the team. The skeleton of the Venus\\u2019 flower basket, however, has pairs of diagonals running in both directions rather than the single diagonals crisscrossing a typical truss. These pairs are spaced apart so the grid looks like a checkerboard, with diagonals crossing every other square. The researchers fabricated and computer-simulated a lattice based on the sponge and compared it with three other lattice structures of the same weight, including the standard truss pattern. In simulations and experiments, they saw the bio-inspired lattice withstand the most stress \\u2014 first from compression in one direction, and then from opposing pressures at three points in another test \\u2014 before breaking. In further simulations, they varied the number of diagonals as well as their spacing and thickness to find the lattice that could sustain the most compression. It turned out to be the one modeled on the sponge. With its additional diagonals, the sponge\\u2019s lattice has more joints than a traditional truss and less distance between the joints, which may allow the structure to sustain greater compression before buckling, Fernandes said. The team detailed their initial findings about the skeleton\\u2019s strength in Nature Materials in September. \\u201cDeeper dives\\u201d into different aspects of these glassy skeletons are ongoing, according to James Weaver, another co-author. The researchers are also pursuing a patent for the sponge-inspired lattice they created. Adding more strength to architectural structures without adding more weight could theoretically allow for longer bridges, lighter infrastructure that\\u2019s easier to transport, or even more streamlined engineering in vehicles bound for space. \\u201cThe process of trial and error over millions of years of evolution brings out the best\\u201d in materials, said Pablo Zavattieri, a professor in civil engineering at Purdue University. However, in the case of Venus\\u2019 flower basket, the evolutionary purpose of its incompressibility is unclear. The sponges often live thousands of meters deep where water pressure is extreme, but this pressure comes from all directions, pressing on opposite sides of the glass beams equally and canceling itself out. The sponge doesn\\u2019t experience a \\u201ccrushing force,\\u201d explained Clint Penick, a biologist at Kennesaw State University in Georgia, via email. Penick said the sponge does need a strong structure, however, to stand up and filter plankton from the water. It also needs to contain a pair of shrimps that often permanently inhabit the sponge once they grow too big to leave it. (These occupants have earned the sponge status as a symbol of eternal love in Japan, where it is given as a wedding present.) Their sturdy skeletons may also deter predators or prevent damage from animals that might collide with them, Penick added, though none of this fully explains their ultra-robustness. Brute strength is not all Venus\\u2019 flower basket offers. The lattice walls of its skeleton are just one of several levels of complexity in its structure. Zoom in to see how its fibers can shift slightly within its lattice walls, or how its arrangement of proteins and silica molecules stops fractures in their tracks. Zoom out to examine how the lacy skeleton allows the living sponge to filter water. Bhate\\u2019s team is investigating the way some of the strands aren\\u2019t completely attached to the others, allowing the skeleton flexibility, and he\\u2019s curious about the way the structure would stand up to twisting. \\u201cIt\\u2019s one of those things that you can spend a lifetime on, and you still have not replicated all those capabilities,\\u201d Bhate said. \\u201cAnd that\\u2019s why it\\u2019s exciting.\\u201d\",\"1036\":\"Ames window illusion illustrates how we don't directly perceive external reality.

[link] [comments]\",\"4394\":\"[link] [comments]\",\"436\":\"In 1972, Frank Wilczek and his thesis adviser, David Gross, discovered the basic theory of the strong force \\u2014 the final pillar of the Standard Model of particle physics. Their work revealed the strange alchemy at work inside the nucleus of an atom. It also turned out to underpin almost all subsequent research into the early universe. Wilczek and Gross went on to share the 2004 Nobel Prize in Physics for the work. At the time it was done, Wilczek was just 21 years old. His influence in the decades since has been profound. He predicted the existence of a hypothetical particle called the axion, which today is a leading candidate for dark matter. He published groundbreaking papers on the nature of the early universe. And just last year, his prediction of the \\u201canyon\\u201d \\u2014 a strange type of particle that only shows up in two-dimensional systems \\u2014 was experimentally confirmed. Wilczek was raised in Queens, New York, the son of immigrants and the product of public schools. He finished high school in two years and college in three. He has taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for 20 years, though pre-pandemic he spent much of his time flying around the world to his concurrent appointments at Arizona State University, Stockholm University and Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where he directs the Wilczek Quantum Center. Wilczek\\u2019s latest book, Fundamentals: Ten Keys to Reality, comes out today. Wilczek told Quanta that he was \\u201cas proud of this book as anything I\\u2019ve ever done in my life.\\u201d Quanta caught up with him twice at his home in Concord, Massachusetts, via Zoom in December. The interviews have been condensed and edited for clarity. Congratulations on Fundamentals. How did the idea for the book come to you? Well, the original idea was rather different from what the book has turned out to be. I was going to write this little book that told some basic facts about the physical world. I thought of it as something that people could read and feel that they knew more than they did before, something that would give them material to talk about at cocktail parties. But as I put together a draft, I wasn\\u2019t happy with what I\\u2019d produced. There are already many books that do that, right? And then when I talked with my nonscientific friends \\u2014 intelligent people, artists, people in literature \\u2014 it didn\\u2019t seem like anything they wanted to read. So, I went back to my desk and I thought about when I was a teenager and when I was turning away from the Catholic faith I\\u2019d been raised in, what did I look for in a book about science and our place in the universe? What would have been helpful to me then? The book I ended up writing was that one. There\\u2019s a lot of God in your book. Yes. There probably aren\\u2019t many scientists at your level who\\u2019d go there. Well, I happen to think these issues are too important for scientists to leave on the table. You know, science actually has a lot to say about what God is or about what God did. Understanding his\\/her\\/its work \\u2014 that\\u2019s a direct way of informing yourself about what God is. There\\u2019s a great tradition that goes back to Galileo, Kepler, Newton, Maxwell and Einstein of looking at religious questions. Most of those people were explicitly, deeply religiously Christian. Einstein, of course, was not. He described himself as having an attitude, similar to that of Spinoza, of a kind of pantheism, a more abstract idea of the world as God. When I was a teen questioning my family\\u2019s Catholicism, I came upon this concept of complementarity that helped me a lot: There can be different ways of approaching the same question. Often there are different ways of describing the same thing. They can be valid each in their own terms, but they may sometimes be very difficult or even impossible to reconcile. So many of the conflicts between religion and science arise because they\\u2019re answering different questions. There are many conflicts where religions say things that are just wrong, but there are many other domains in which they are just addressing different questions. In science, you\\u2019re broadly asking, \\u201cHow does this work?\\u201d In religion, you\\u2019re asking, \\u201cWhat does this mean and what should I do about it?\\u201d Are you religious? Physics is my religious belief. In the sense that in physics we discover a fantastically wonderful world out there that\\u2019s rich in potential, rich in realization, and that has ample scope for fantasy, because the laws are so strange and there\\u2019s so much stuff out there to understand. And when you understand it, you understand how that could be. I learn that I myself am very small. But I am also very large because I contain multitudes, as Walt Whitman said. I can process information. I can understand things. I can imagine. I can have fun. That\\u2019s the essence of my religion. I learn my religion from the study of what the world is and how it works. Tell us a bit more about this teenage boy who was trying to figure out the universe and his place in it. I grew up in New York City \\u2014 Queens. My parents were immigrants. My father from Poland. My mother from Italy. I\\u2019d say we were somewhere between upper-lower class and lower-middle class. My father worked as a technician. My mother was a homemaker. Both were very intelligent, though they hadn\\u2019t been to college. My father had to quit high school in order to help support his family during the Depression. But they were very invested in the idea that their children should have a better life than they did. We were also very fortunate that we lived in New York and had access to the public school system that served me very well. Almost from the moment I entered school, I was given IQ tests. When I scored high, my parents were called in and told, \\u201cFrank is exceptional. You should do everything to help him.\\u201d How did they respond to having a prodigy in the household? Once the school started telling them how smart I was, it changed the dynamics within the family. I wasn\\u2019t this little kid they could boss around anymore. Though they were themselves very intelligent, I think they were somewhat intimidated by me. They allowed me to get toys that were clever, even though we couldn\\u2019t afford them \\u2014 mechanical toys and telescopes. We\\u2019d go to a special bookstore for science and philosophy books. I read a lot of Bertrand Russell, who meant a lot to me. I think my parents were kind of puzzled by me. When I wanted to do strange things, they\\u2019d let me do them. I think my mother sort of idolized me. It was assumed I\\u2019d become some kind of scientist. She always said, \\u201cYou\\u2019re going to cure cancer.\\u201d I\\u2019m going to say something very immodest here. The fact that in school I got this kind of validation that was very objective and not faked gave me enormous confidence. I did very well on various tests and competitions. I had a lot of confidence. That\\u2019s stayed with me for the rest of my life. Scientists need that sort of confidence to take intellectual risks. Did you go to the Bronx High School of Science? No. That was an hour\\u2019s commute away. I went to a very large Queens public high school, Martin Van Buren, where I was on the nerd track with about 20 other kids. We all went to the same AP classes and hung out together. We\\u2019re still in touch, to this day. When I went off to the University of Chicago at 16 \\u2014 I had skipped two grades \\u2014 on the whole, the students there were not as good as my pals back at Van Buren. On the other hand, the professors were on a different plane. They wanted to understand things in a big way. At Chicago, at least from the faculty, I felt I was getting into contact with the cutting edge of human intellectual exploration. I had a lot of amorphous ambitions. Chicago was a good place to try to figure out what I wanted to do. For instance, I quickly discovered that lab work wasn\\u2019t for me. I saw it can be fussy work, repetitive. So I went on to explore computer science, physics, biology. I was in a holding pattern. Eventually I settled on mathematics because I love to do puzzles, and that merged with the idea of solving equations and manipulating data in the broad sense. I had these amorphous ideas like wanting to investigate the way the mind works using mathematical logic. Did math work out? As a college major, it did. I finished in three years and then went off to do graduate work in mathematics at Princeton. There, I experienced a big shock. Graduate school was not a matter of learning things that others had already figured out, but of producing something new. They gave me an office with a blackboard and said, \\u201cDo something interesting.\\u201d Suddenly, I was being treated as an adult. I found this really difficult. I went into a kind of crisis. But then I had a tremendous piece of luck. A miracle happened. I happened to attend some physics lectures, and that got me involved with this project of understanding how quantum field theory worked and whether it could be applied to the strong interaction. That was basically the first piece of serious research I\\u2019d ever tried to do. And it worked! And it led directly to a Nobel Prize. I did hard calculations that nobody else could do. I was collaborating with David Gross, who was a much more experienced scientist. And so brilliant. Working with him, I felt that I was making a real contribution. In subsequent years I was able to spin off one successful application of those ideas after another \\u2014 or do other creative things like axions, though that was much later. I knew right away that if the theory we were proposing was correct, it was potentially a very big deal. I remember saying to David, \\u201cIf the experiments bear this out, we\\u2019ll get the Nobel Prize.\\u201d Now, the prize came 30 years later, in 2004. But the personal validation was instantaneous. We did the calculations in the winter of 1972, and we published in the spring. That summer I went to my first conference. It was very small, at a place called the Downingtown Inn. But Feynman was there, the Feynman, and he talked about our work. He said, \\u201cThis is really important.\\u201d I was 21. You could have been crippled by such a remarkable early success. Many people are. Not at all. I think for the kind of work I do, having self-confidence is pure gold. To break new ground, you need to be willing to go out on a limb and take risks. Because of my early successes, my mistakes, when I made them, were not as devastating as they could have been. To be honest, I\\u2019ve made some. One was a mistake of lost opportunity. I feel I should have discovered inflation. I had all the necessary pieces; I was at the right place at the right time with the right kind of knowledge. I was just thinking about other things. One of my big successes in recent years was in proposing the concept of a time crystal, which has kind of flourished into a whole field. But in the early paper, my main example turned out to be not very good. It was unstable technically. It was not scientifically sound. The general direction was good, but the detailed implementation was not. What do you tell yourself when you\\u2019ve made a mistake? I don\\u2019t dwell on it. Listen, I like working with imaginative ideas. Mistakes are sometimes the price of doing that. Let\\u2019s talk about one of your imaginative ideas \\u2014 axions. They are the hypothetical particle that may make up dark matter and thus may be a key to understanding the early universe. You\\u2019ve been theorizing and publishing about them for more than 40 years. How did you get started on axions? One night in the summer of 1977 I took a long walk at Fermilab and decided to think about issues around the Higgs particle or particles. First I thought about how one might detect them. I basically cracked the problem, though that didn\\u2019t become clear until much later. Then I thought about whether there might be more than one Higgs field, and if there was anything interesting one could say about that kind of possibility. The most intriguing idea that occurred to me was that with more than one Higgs field you could have symmetry patterns. The next day I went to the library and looked up what people had done on all these questions. I found that Roberto Peccei and Helen Quinn had not only considered the Higgs symmetry, but showed that it could address a fundamental problem in physics. But Peccei and Quinn hadn\\u2019t realized a very striking consequence of the symmetry, namely the existence of a very light particle \\u2014 what we now call the axion. My first thought was that such a particle would surely have been observed if it existed, so I didn\\u2019t work on it as urgently as I did on the other idea. But as I considered it more closely, I gradually convinced myself that maybe the axion \\u2014 which is what I called it, from the start \\u2014 might possibly exist after all, because one after the other my attempts to rule it out failed. It\\u2019s not every day that you stumble into new ways of asking and possibly answering such fundamental questions, so I got sucked in. A few years later I got invited by Stephen Hawking to a now legendary conference, the 1982 Nuffield conference in Cambridge, where early-universe cosmology was the main subject. Stephen asked me to give the summary talk. I felt I should try to live up to the occasion and present some new ideas, so I raised the question of how the axion field settles down after the Big Bang, and whether it might leave an observable relic. John Preskill, Mark Wise and I worked this out and discovered that in fact lots of axions get left over, and that they would have just the right properties to supply the \\u201cdark matter\\u201d that cosmologists seem to need. Given the fact that you and the others were heavy hitters, why were axions for so long the Rodney Dangerfields of the physics world? They didn\\u2019t get much respect. Well, axions were a very different kind of particle, quite different from anything before. Without an understanding of the deep theoretical ideas behind it, axions just seemed outlandish. That\\u2019s changed. The case for dark matter has become much stronger, and axions have become much more popular. Certainly, the case for dark matter in the universe is very strong now, almost universally accepted. That dark matter is probably some new kind of new particle is almost universally accepted, too. It fits many, many independent lines of evidence. And it could be the axion. The axion has all the right properties, which is not trivial at all. And also, the original fundamental problem that the axion was designed to address, this problem of why the laws look the same forward and backward in time, has been around for almost 50 years now, and axions are the only solution that stands up. So we need it. We need it. I think we can look forward to the discovery that the dark matter is in fact axions. For a long time, the alternate leading candidate for dark matter was something called a WIMP. Has it fallen by the wayside? I think so. It was supposed to emerge from supersymmetric unification theories, certainly an attractive idea. But what\\u2019s happened is that at the Large Hadron Collider, supersymmetry was not discovered, and then in a large number of other searches for WIMPs, they were not discovered, and so the empirical case against them mounted. By process of elimination, that left axions as kind of the last man standing. Now, it\\u2019s not quite true that all modifications of the WIMP theory have been ruled out. But WIMPs are getting less plausible, whereas axions look better and better. If axions are proved to be the dark matter, will you have shaken up the physics world a second time? Well, yes and no. If axions are it, it wouldn\\u2019t shake everything up because there\\u2019s already a well-established body of theory about it. The basic concepts have been around for 40 years. There are thousands of papers. But still, it\\u2019s one thing to have theoretical speculation and another to have the world. I\\u2019ve enjoyed working on the axion \\u2014 it\\u2019s been fun. With others, I started in the early 1980s proposing that it might be a candidate for dark matter, and that opened up new ways to look for it. It was an interesting concept to work on compared to QCD , which had been solved. Today, many people are working on axions. And that\\u2019s inspiring, and it keeps me connected to younger people. On the other hand, it\\u2019s not yet the same thing as what David and I did on the strong interaction, which is part of the fabric of fundamental law. What are you working on now? Several things \\u2014 an eclectic mix. I\\u2019m very actively involved in trying to design axion antennas that will finally detect them. I\\u2019m having a lot of fun working with experimentalists and engineering-type people to do that. I\\u2019m working on a state of matter called anyons that I think could open up a whole new area of physics and could change computing. I have another bright idea on something related to quantum information theory. I\\u2019m very interested to follow up on time crystals; I think that has flourished beyond my initial expectations. And it\\u2019s gone in different directions. Have you had to put these projects on hold because of the pandemic? Oh, no. No! They\\u2019ve been fostered because of it. I\\u2019m not schlepping around and going to conferences and traveling. I mean, I\\u2019m eating better. I\\u2019ve lost 15 pounds, taken up juggling, doing exercise. It\\u2019s given me time to do creative thinking. In a way I\\u2019ve been going back to school, as if I were a graduate student. I want to learn more about machine learning. I\\u2019m going to be 70 in May, but I feel younger now than I\\u2019ve felt for many years. You know, when I was a teen and trying to put it all together, I thought that life was a matter of figuring out the answers to questions and that was that. Now I\\u2019m learning that good answers lead to better questions, and that the cycle never ends.\",\"2762\":\"Surviving The Deadliest, Dumbest Game [new video] --a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/invidious.snopyta.org\\/ACtsYN1TWLg\\\"\\/aimg src=\\\"https:\\/\\/nitter.net\\/pic\\/media%2FEpxysUJXMAAtTmm.jpg\\\" style=\\\"max-width:250px;\\\" \\/\",\"4393\":\"[link] [comments]\",\"3048\":\"[link] [comments]\",\"1314\":\"EVERY EPISODE OF MIND FIELD IS NOW FREE for the rest of the year!

He formulated an equation that is still used today - the law of universal gravitation. But it had problems - action at a distance and the the rate of precession of Mercury 250 years later, Einstein, with the General theory of relativity, solved the riddle of Mercury\\u2019s precession, and showed that gravity was due to a bending of space-time itself. Today, we find holes in Einstein\\u2019s theory, such as its inability to explain the singularity inside black holes, and the big bang. Newton\\u2019s and Einstein\\u2019s equation are similar . They both have Newton\\u2019s gravitational constant. In Newton\\u2019s equation, a force is on the left side, created by mass on the right side. In Einstein\\u2019s equation, the analog of force, the curvature of space-time is on the left side. And mass-energy-momentum tensor is on the right side. A tensor can be an array of vectors, scalars, or other tensors represented by an N x N matrix. Although Einstein's equation looks simple, it is actually 10 equations, and is very complicated. The equations describe curvature of space-time by treating it as being flat at infinitesimally small distances. So general relativity behaves like special relativity at these small distances. But overall curvature is taken into account. The Ricci curvature tensor tells us how space-time is deviating from flat. The second term on the left side is composed of R, the scalar curvature, which is how much the space is changed at a point, such that you know how to correctly measure distances. Little g is the metric tensor. It tells you the geometry and structure of spacetime. Together this term defines how distances are calculated, given a curvature at a point. Sometimes a third term is added, lambda. the cosmological constant. This describes the intrinsic energy density of empty space. It is the mathematical expression for dark energy \\u2013 the accelerating expansion of the universe. The right side has a constant which is the Einstein gravitational constant. It is a conversion factor to make sure we get the proper units. On the right side - T is the stress energy momentum tensor, which tells us the density of energy and momentum at each point in space time. It is a source of the curvature. The way these equations are formulated is by treating space-time in 4 dimensions. Three spatial dimensions, and one dimension of time. This is incorporated in the mu and nu subscripts. When mu and nu are zero and zero, the left side describes the speeding up or slowing down of time at a point in space. The right side describes the energy at that point. If the mu and nu are zero and one, the left represents the stretching of time within one spatial dimension. The right side is the momentum. If mu and nu are one and one, the left side describs the stretching of space in one of the dimensions. The right side is the pressure at a point in space. General relativity is generally true - it predicts bending of light around massive objects, which has been observed, and it predicts that time will run more slowly on the surface of earth than a mountaintop, which has been confirmed. But it is incomplete. The problem is that it does not fit with an even more accurate theory - quantum mechanics. For example, quantum theory says that the electron in an atom is in a superposed state, meaning it is in multiple positions from the nucleus at the SAME time. We only know the probability of finding it at particular radius, if we measure it. Since the electron has mass, general relativity says it must curve space-time. But if it is in multiple locations at the same time, then where is the curvature? Is it also at multiple locations at the same time? We don\\u2019t know. There is nothing in general relativity akin to superposition. #quantumgravity #einsteinfieldequations #generalrelativity GR also predicts matter and energy being compressed to an infinitely small point with infinite curvature in a black hole. But since the equations treat space-time mathematically as being flat at infinitesimally small distances, a problem occurs when space is not flat at infinitesimally small distances, at a singularity. Mathematical infinities are usually wrong, so there is probably something else going on. There are two theories that are promising, Loop Quantum Gravity and String theory - the subject of my next video.\",\"1043\":\"The most elegant interpretation of quantum mechanics is the universe is constantly splitting A portion of this video was sponsored by Norton.

We can use the Schr\\u00f6dinger equation to solve for and evolve wave functions. Then we invoke wave-particle duality, in essence things we detect as particles can behave as waves when they aren't interacting with anything. But when there is a measurement, the wave function collapses leaving us with a definite particle detection. If we repeat the experiment many times, we find the statistics of these results mirror the amplitude of the wave function squared. Hence the Born rule came into being, saying the wave function should be interpreted statistically, that our universe at the most fundamental scale is probabilistic rather than deterministic. This did not sit well with scientists like Einstein and Schr\\u00f6dinger who believed there must be more going on, perhaps 'hidden variables'. In the 1950's Hugh Everett proposed the Many Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. It is so logical in hindsight but with a bias towards the classical world, experiments and measurements to guide their thinking, it's understandable why the founders of quantum theory didn't come up with it. Rather than proposing different dynamics for measurement, Everett suggests that measurement is something that happens naturally in the course of quantum particles interacting with each other. The conclusion is inescapable. There is nothing special about measurement, it is just the observer becoming entangled with a wave function in a superposition. Since one observer can experience only their own branch, it appears as if the other possibilities have disappeared but in reality there is no reason why they could not still exist and just fail to interact with the other branches. This is caused by environmental decoherence.

We exchanged emails to make sure I got my facts straight for this video. Below is an excerpt from her email to me, responding to my claims that start with a dash: - Around half of airborne dust particles under 100um are skin scales This is true for climates, regions and seasons where people live mostly indoors. The 1 to 2 g of skin scales shed each 24 hours will end up in places where people are present (and rub their skin or have textile moving over the skin). You can also look at it from a different angle: What else has the same size and could contribute? That will usually be pollen from outdoor sources, also depending on season, region and climate, as well as the ventilation regime of the building. However, taken as the median value over a whole year, I consider your statement correct for regions with a temperate climate. - 53% of dust particles vacuumed from a mattress were found to be skin scales It depends a little on the type of mattress. For polyether mattresses the amount may even be larger. For mattresses made of natural material it could be less since the mattress-material will also give off small particles. - larger particles consist mostly of fibers, eg. cotton, paper, wool, synthetics That's true .. including bread crumbs ..... \\ud83d\\ude42 - skin scales seem to form a larger fraction of dust where we spend more time, e.g. in or near bed. ..... and on the couch used to view television or be active in gaming. It has to do with the constant production of skin scales over the 24 hours. - skin scales form a smaller fraction of dust if there are significant other sources, e.g. carpeting, dirt from outside etc. Yes, everyting you walk on with your shoes or that recieves dirt from the outside with other means, will have a lessr percentage of human skin scales. However, do not forget the skin scales of pets that will also be an active allergen for many people, and a food source for house dust mites. Information on dust particle size \\u00a9ISO.

Classical mechanics - two main concepts worth knowing. The first is Newton\\u2019s second law: F= ma: Force equals mass times acceleration. If you apply a force to a fixed mass, it tells you how much acceleration you will get. And knowing acceleration which is the change in velocity, you can make predictions. The second equation is the law of universal gravitation. it allows us to determine the motion of heavenly bodies. It says that the gravitational attraction between two bodies is the product of their masses divided by the distance between them squared, times a constant, called Newton\\u2019s gravitational constant. Energy is not a vector like force or momentum, but it is just a number. Work is closely related to energy. It is force times distance traveled. Energy for most objects consists of kinetic energy plus potential energy. KE is the energy of motion, It is KE = \\u00bd M V^2 \\u2013 the more mass you have and\\/or the more velocity you have, the more energy you have. Gravitational potential energy is expressed as PE = m g h \\u2013 mass times the gravitational acceleration times the height. The total energy of an object is both Kinetic energy plus potential energy. Potential energy can take many forms. Gasoline or petrol has chemical potential energy. Important: Energy is always conserved. It is not created or destroyed. It only changes form. Thermodynamics is the study of work, heat, and energy on a system. We showed energy is how much work you could do. But another form of energy is thermal energy. If a car is moving and you apply the brakes, the kinetic energy of the car gets converted to thermal energy, created by friction of the car\\u2019s brakes. Temperature is the average kinetic energy of atoms in a system. Thermal energy is the total kinetic energy of atoms in a system. Entropy is a measure of disorder, or more accurately, the information required to describe the micro states of a system. The 2nd law of thermodynamics states that entropy of an isolated system can never decrease. Energy at lower entropy can do more work than energy at high entropy. The one way flow of Entropy seems to be the only reason we have a forward flow of time. Electromagnetism is the study of the interaction between electrically charged particles. The essentials are in Maxwell\\u2019s equations. If you have a static object with a charge, it will affect only other charges. If you have a static magnet, it will affect only other magnets. It will not affect charges. But if you have a moving charge, it will affect a magnet. And if you have a moving magnet, it will affect a charge. The constants mu naught and epsilon naught are the permeability and permittivity of free space. These two constants determine the speed of light because they measure the resistance of space to changing electric and magnetic fields. Special Relativity: Einstein presumed that the speed is the same in any frame of reference. This was one of the postulates. The second postulate was principle of relativity - the laws of physics are the same for all observes who are moving at the same velocity relative to each other. Einstein showed that the only way these can be true is if time was not fixed, but was relative. General relativity: Later Einstein showed using the same assumptions, there would be no way to tell if you were in an accelerating reference frame or standing stationary on earth. A flashlight beam will bend in gravity. But since light always takes the shortest path between any two points, this means that space-time itself is bending. Quantum mechanics: Three principles are important. First by Max Planck, says that energy is not continuous, but is quantized. The amount of energy equals the frequency of the radiation times Planck's constant. Using this, Einstein later showed that a photon is both a wave and a particle. The second is the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle: you cannot know both a particle\\u2019s exact position and it\\u2019s exact momentum at the same time. For a particle with mass, this means if you know exactly where a particle is, you don\\u2019t know how fast going. If you know exactly how fast it\\u2019s going, you don\\u2019t know where it is. #allphysics #arvinash Third is Schrodinger's equation: prior to measurement, quantum systems are in superposed states. This means that their properties can only be expressed as a wave function. A wave function simplified is a set of probabilities. So in a hydrogen atom, you can\\u2019t know where to find the electron in advance. All you can know is the probability of where you might find it, if you measured it. Prior to measurement, all quantum systems are clouds or waves of probabilities. The electron here AND there simultaneously. This is not a limitation of our measuring devices. It is a limitation of reality.\",\"4389\":\"[link] [comments]\",\"2756\":\"I'm trying to become a person who can make circles on an Etch A Sketch.

There are a few obvious ones: we're well above the 99.9th percentile in terms of how hot and how dense the space we occupy is. Our planet is also unique among others, insofar as it has liquid water, which most planets don't. But we would expect these properties to be present in an environment that can harbor life, so it's not tremendously interesting that they're present. Once you ignore the conditions necessary for life, there isn't anything obvious that remains that makes the space we occupy particularly out-of-the-ordinary. We seem to live with some run-of-the-mill neighboring planets, orbiting a main sequence star that sits in a relatively quiet part of a galaxy that is one of many Sb shaped galaxies in the observable universe. There are astronomical bodies that just so happen to have some cool properties that wouldn't appear to affect the capacity for life. Some planets have nonspherical moons, or moons with a particularly elliptical orbit, or live in a star system with an unusually large number of planets. Some star systems live inside nebulae. Some are on the very outskirts of their galaxy. Some galaxies are irregularly shaped, and some live in intergalactic voids. Our planet could have had any of these properties and life would still be possible (though it may look different). But it doesn't. But I'm not convinced that there aren't any interesting properties about where we are that aren't tied to life existing here in the universe. Is there anything about our planet, our star system, our local group, our galaxy, or our galactic cluster that is extraordinary merely by coincidence?

This problem was solved by Niels Bohr who showed that electrons orbit in distinct orbitals, and can only gain or lose energy in chunks, not continuously. Bohr's atom was based on Max Planck's simple equation. Planck introduced Planck\\u2019s constant, h, which is the proportionality factor between energy and the frequency of radiation. Bohr noticed that Planck\\u2019s constant had units of angular momentum, so he guessed that this was the minimum angular momentum that an electron could have to remain in a stable orbit. He showed that the atom goes from a high energy state to a lower one, proportional to this constant. Here's how to derive the uncertainty principle: In the double slit experiment, when monochromatic light goes through two slits we get an interference pattern just like if it was a wave. A single slit produces a similar diffraction pattern where we see a central very high peak, and very faint peaks elsewhere. The width of the slit represents the uncertainty in position, because the electron could be anywhere along the slit. The distance to the interference pattern represents the momentum. The uncertainty in the momentum is represented by the distance from the center of the pattern to the first interference pattern. Louis de Broglie showed that the wavelength, lambda for a particle with mass is equal to h\\/p, where h is Planck\\u2019s constant, and p is the momentum. Using trigonometry, we can get a series of equations showing how the uncertainty in position and uncertainty in momentum are equal to h. This is essentially what the uncertainty principle is. This is slightly different than how the equation is typically written with is greater than or equal to h\\/4*pi, because of some imprecisions in this approach to the derivation. A more precise approach requires higher level math and use of Fourier transforms. Here's a link to one such derivation if you are interested: http:\\/\\/applet-magic.com\\/Uncertainty.htm The important thing to remember is that the uncertainty in the momentum and the position are inversely related. As one gets bigger, the other gets smaller. This is not a limitation of our ability to measure the position and momentum. It is a limitation of reality! How does this relate to the Bohr model of the atom? The Bohr radius, where Niels Bohr calculated the electron would be at its lowest energy state in the hydrogen atom is 5.29x 10^-11 m. The velocity can be calculated to be 2.18 x 10^6 m\\/s for the same electron. The mass of the electron is 9.11 x 10^-31 kg. Now we can calculate the momentum of this electron because momentum is just mass times velocity. This would be equal to about 2 x 10^-24 kg*m\\/s. But there is always some uncertainty. So for example if there was a 10% uncertainty in velocity, then delta p would be one tenth of this or 2 x 10^-25 kg*m\\/s. Calculating from the uncertainty equation, we get: Delta X is 26 x 10^-11 meters. Compared to the Bohr radius, this is 5X larger. A 10% uncertainty in momentum results in a huge uncertainty in the position. It tells us that the Bohr radius is fundamentally wrong. The truth is that the electron doesn\\u2019t just sit at any fixed radius. There is a constant balance between the uncertainty in its momentum and position, such that it forms a cloud of probability around the proton. This cloud extends far below and far beyond the Bohr radius. And using the Schrodinger's equation, we can calculate the probability of finding it at certain locations if we measure it. So why do we keep teaching students about Bohr\\u2019s inaccurate model? It is useful for approximate calculations, and explains a number of features of atoms on the periodic table. It is useful for chemistry. #uncertaintyprinciple #heisenberg If we used the same equation and put in the mass of a tennis ball and a 1% uncertainty in momentum, we get that the uncertainty in the position, equals 1.55 x 10^-33 m. This is so small that we would never notice it. Similarly, we don\\u2019t notice it in anything else either that we can see with our eyes. The big lesson to be learned here is that the central concept in quantum mechanics is only noticeable at very tiny scales.\",\"4233\":\"From my reading, corals bleach due to ocean acidification which is primarily due to excess CO2, this leads to poor reef health if not complete death. Given the fragility of reef structures, I assume that bleached reefs would eventually fall and form into sand which is most likely incredibly hard to date and historically analyze like ice in the polar caps. Is there a way to specifically look at the acidification of coral over millennia, or maybe the evidence of acidification leading to bleaching? I ask due to an argument about the validity of human-caused global warming models, especially around natural global warming cycles and human contribution to existing (natural) CO2 levels in the atmosphere. So I'm wondering what kind of information we can draw about acidification.

The primary challenge is that according to the equations of QM, all particles exist in a state of superposition. In fact, before it is measured, the particle is said to be in many states at once. How does one explain the transition from the behavior of objects at quantum scales to their classical behavior upon measurement? The various interpretations of quantum mechanics are attempts to explain this transition. The standard is the Copenhagen interpretation because if was devised in Copenhagen, Denmark by Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg. This is taught to most students in college. But even a majority of physicists do not agree that this is the correct interpretation. There is no single interpretation that has a consensus agreement. Most interpretations focus on the Schrodinger equation and the wavefunction to explain quantum behavior. This equation was developed by Irish-Austrian physicist Erwin Schrodinger in 1926. It contains a wave function, represented by the Greek letter psi. German physicist Max Born formulated the interpretation of psi, which is that the square of the norm of psi is the probability of finding a particle in any one particular state if we were to measure it. The concept of measurement was introduced to explain what we actually see when we make an observation. The fact is that even if it were possible for us to directly observe quantum particles, we would never see them being in superposition, we would only observe them being in one state or another. Let\\u2019s look at this in terms of the famous Schrodinger\\u2019s cat experiment. We have a box with 4 things in it, cat, a radioactive source, a detector with hammer attached and a vial of poison gas. If the detector detects radiation, the hammer will smash the vial of gas and the cat will die. If no detection, the cat will stay alive. If we look at this from the quantum mechanical point of view, there are two possibilities for the wave function of this system - cat dead or cat alive. Both are in superposition. In the Copenhagen interpretation, as soon as you open the box to make an observation, one of the probabilities comes true, and the other probability disappears. The wave function \\\"collapses\\\" as the result of a measurement by an observer or apparatus external to the quantum system. A measurement is an interaction of the quantum system with a classical system, which can be the observer. The problem with this interpretation it doesn\\u2019t explain how this collapse happens - what is the mechanism? This is the measurement problem. Bohr might have said it just fits the data, so we know collapse occurs. An alternative, the many worlds interpretation of the same event would be that no collapse occurs, but that two different worlds with two different results exist simultaneously. This interpretation was formulated by Hugh Everett in 1957 as a graduate student at Princeton University. Some say this is the simplest interpretation of quantum mechanics because it introduces no other assumptions, other than the Schrodinger equation. The distinction that the many worlds interpretation makes vs. the Copenhagen interpretation is that it says, the observer is also a quantum system, and is entangled with the cat. Both the cat and observer are part of the same wave function. So the reality where the cat is alive, is but one world. But there is another reality the cat is dead. Both worlds exist. You just happen to find yourself in one of them. Why do we find ourselves in only one branch? Everettians say it is due to decoherence. Quantum decoherence is the physical process that is used to describe how quantum states transition to the one state that we experience. The key realization is that in reality, you have more than just you and the cat entangled. Both will also be entangled with their environment because THAT is also a quantum system. The environment inside the box for a cat that is alive will be different than the environment for a cat that is dead. Because the entanglement with the environment now enters the picture, the coherent superpositon between you and the cat is broken. The Schrodinger equation says that the two parts of the wave function above are perpendicular to each other, that have no connection to each other. This can be interpreted as two separate worlds. #copenhageninterpretation #manyworldsinterpretation It is as if the universe splits into two separate worlds. This is decoherence. It is another way of explaining how quantum superposition gets lost, by interaction with the environment. You can also think of this as the quantum nature of the original 2 component system leaking information into the environment due to its with it.\",\"3244\":\"This year, two teams of physicists made profound progress on ideas that could bring about the next revolution in physics.

Cosmological constant describing the acceleration present in the universe\\u2019s expansion. fine structure constant which describes strength of the electromagnetic force, and the strong coupling constant \\u2013 which defines the strength of the strong nuclear force. But 4 are special fundamental constants apply to everything everywhere. The gravitational constant G - It can be thought of as the proportionality factor between the strength of gravity and the masses creating that gravity. It has units of length cubed divided by mass times time squared. The speed of light, C is like a conversion factor between Mass and energy, or a conversion factor between the time dimension and the three spatial dimensions of our 4 dimensional universe. Planck\\u2019s constant is the fundamental constant that sets the minimum scale of quantum phenomenon. It can be found in just about any quantum mechanics equations. It has units of mass times distance squared divided by time. Boltzmann\\u2019s constant plays a role in determining the amount of vibrational energy contained in the atom related to temperature. It is just the definition of the energy contained in one degree Kelvin and has units of energy per degree. Using just 3 constants, G, c, and h we can get many Planck scale limits. If we manipulate them mathematically, we get a length. which is the Planck length. It is the minimum length that would be meaningful in quantum mechanics. : We also get time, which is the Planck time. It is the minimum time that can exist that would be meaningful in quantum physics. We also get energy by rearranging some of these constants. This is the Planck energy- the maximum energy that could be contained in a cube that had a size of one Planck length. We can convert this Planck energy into mass by using Einstein\\u2019s equation. This represents the maximum mass that a cube of one Planck length could have. Since these numbers are ubiquitous in physics, physicists often just use what\\u2019s called natural units, and set these constants equal to one. What is the significance of the Planck scale? The Planck length is the shortest length that means anything in the equations of quantum mechanics. This is not to say that something smaller doesn\\u2019t exist. It is the smallest scale that we can theoretically probe with particle accelerators. If string theory is true, then the strings would be as small as the Planck length, and would also be the smallest size of the loops in loops quantum gravity. Strings would vibrate at minimum time scales of the Planck time. The movement of the spin network in LQG would occur in increments of Planck time. Planck time is the time it takes for light to travel one Planck length. We have no idea what occurred prior to this time, nor do we have a model for what could have occurred. Using the word before may in fact be meaningless because time itself started at this point. This would be the true beginning of creation. What lies below the Planck scale? It could be a kind of quantum foam where gravity could fluctuate or be in superposition. Could space-time be in superposition like other quantum phenomenon? Perhaps, but this would violate some of the current understanding of gravity. Planck energy converted to Planck mass is really a lot of mass equivalent to energy in a tank of gasoline or petrol in your car. Some people have used the precision of the constants to argue for fine tuning, that any slight variation would have resulted in conditions which could not have created matter, or life as we know it. #planckscale #arvinash #wherephysicsends Others say that, the universe isn\\u2019t all that fine tuned for life because almost all the volume of the universe supports no life. Life only occurs on a very limited volume of the universe, namely on very special planets that have just the right conditions.\",\"5238\":\"[link] [comments]\",\"5174\":\"[link] [comments]\",\"4237\":\"A lot of the gas in farts is produced by bacteria, but how much?

It was the brightest and closest supernova since the invention of the telescope some four centuries earlier, and just about every observatory turned to take a look. Perhaps most excitingly, specialized observatories buried deep underground captured shy subatomic particles called neutrinos streaming out of the blast. These particles were first proposed as the driving force behind supernovas in 1966, which made their detection a source of comfort to theorists who had been trying to understand the inner workings of the explosions. Yet over the decades, astrophysicists had constantly bumped into what appeared to be a fatal flaw in their neutrino-powered models. Neutrinos are famously aloof particles, and questions remained over exactly how neutrinos transfer their energy to the star\\u2019s ordinary matter under the extreme conditions of a collapsing star. Whenever theorists tried to model these intricate particle motions and interactions in computer simulations, the supernova\\u2019s shock wave would stall and fall back on itself. The failures \\u201centrenched the idea that our leading theory for how supernovas explode maybe doesn\\u2019t work,\\u201d said Sean Couch, a computational astrophysicist at Michigan State University. Of course, the specifics of what goes on deep inside a supernova as it explodes have always been mysterious. It\\u2019s a cauldron of extremes, a turbulent soup of transmuting matter, where particles and forces often ignored in our everyday world become critical. Compounding the problem, the explosive interior is largely hidden from view, shrouded by clouds of hot gas. Understanding the details of supernovas \\u201chas been a central unsolved problem in astrophysics,\\u201d said Adam Burrows, an astrophysicist at Princeton University who has studied supernovas for more than 35 years. In recent years, however, theorists have been able to home in on the surprisingly complex mechanisms that make supernovas tick. Simulations that explode have become the norm, rather than the exception, Burrows wrote in Nature this month. Rival research groups\\u2019 computer codes are now agreeing on how supernova shock waves evolve, while simulations have advanced so far that even the effects of Einstein\\u2019s notoriously intricate general relativity are being included. The role of neutrinos is finally becoming understood. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a watershed moment,\\u201d said Couch. What they\\u2019re finding is that without turbulence, collapsing stars may never form supernovas at all. A Chaotic Dance For much of a star\\u2019s life, the inward pull of gravity is delicately balanced by the outward push of radiation from nuclear reactions inside the star\\u2019s core. As the star runs out of fuel, gravity takes hold. The core collapses in on itself \\u2014 plummeting at 150,000 kilometers per hour \\u2014 causing temperatures to surge to 100 billion degrees Celsius and fusing the core into a solid ball of neutrons. The outer layers of the star continue to fall inward, but as they hit this incompressible neutron core, they bounce off it, creating a shock wave. In order for the shock wave to become an explosion, it must be driven outward with enough energy to escape the pull of the star\\u2019s gravity. The shock wave must also fight against the inward spiral of the star\\u2019s outermost layers, which are still falling onto the core. Until recently, the forces powering the shock wave were only understood in the blurriest of terms. For decades, computers were only powerful enough to run simplified models of the collapsing core. Stars were treated as perfect spheres, with the shock wave emanating from the center the same way in every direction. But as the shock wave moves outward in these one-dimensional models, it slows and then falters. Only in the last few years, with the growth of supercomputers, have theorists had enough computing power to model massive stars with the complexity needed to achieve explosions. The best models now integrate details such as the micro-level interactions between neutrinos and matter, the disordered motions of fluids, and recent advances in many different fields of physics \\u2014 from nuclear physics to stellar evolution. Moreover, theorists can now run many simulations each year, allowing them to freely tweak the models and try out different starting conditions. One turning point came in 2015, when Couch and his collaborators ran a three-dimensional computer model of the final minutes of a massive star\\u2019s collapse. Although the simulation only mapped out 160 seconds of the star\\u2019s life, it illuminated the role of an underappreciated player that helps stalled shock waves turn into fully fledged explosions. Hidden inside the belly of the beast, particles twist and turn chaotically. \\u201cIt\\u2019s like boiling water on your stove. There are massive overturns of fluid inside the star, going at thousands of kilometers per second,\\u201d said Couch. This turbulence creates extra pressure behind the shock wave, pushing it further from the star\\u2019s center. Away from the center, the inward pull of gravity is weaker, and there\\u2019s less inward-falling matter to temper the shock wave. The turbulent matter bouncing around behind the shock wave also has more time to absorb neutrinos. Energy from the neutrinos then heats the matter and drives the shock wave into an explosion. For years, researchers had failed to realize the importance of turbulence, because it only reveals its full impact in simulations run in three dimensions. \\u201cWhat nature does effortlessly, it has taken us decades to achieve as we went up from one dimension to two and three dimensions,\\u201d said Burrows. These simulations have also revealed that turbulence results in an asymmetric explosion, where the star looks a bit like an hourglass. As the explosion pushes outward in one direction, matter keeps falling onto the core in another direction, fueling the star\\u2019s explosion further. These new simulations are giving researchers a better understanding of exactly how supernovas have shaped the universe we see today. \\u201cWe can get the correct explosion energy range, and we can get the neutron star masses that we see left behind,\\u201d said Burrows. Supernovas are largely responsible for creating the universe\\u2019s budget of hefty elements such as oxygen and iron, and theorists are starting to use simulations to predict exactly how much of these heavy elements should be around. \\u201cWe\\u2019re now starting to tackle problems that were unimaginable in the past,\\u201d said Tuguldur Sukhbold, a theoretical and computational astrophysicist at Ohio State University. The Next Blast Despite the exponential rise in computing power, a supernova simulation is far rarer than an observation in the sky. \\u201cTwenty years ago there were around 100 supernovae being discovered every year,\\u201d said Edo Berger, an astronomer at Harvard University. \\u201cNow we\\u2019re discovering 10,000 or 20,000 every year,\\u201d a rise driven by new telescopes that quickly and repeatedly scan the night sky. By contrast, in a year theorists carry out around 30 computer simulations. A single simulation, re-creating just a few minutes of core collapse, can take many months. \\u201cYou check in every day and it\\u2019s only gone a millisecond,\\u201d said Couch. \\u201cIt\\u2019s like watching molasses in the wintertime.\\u201d The broad accuracy of the new simulations has astrophysicists excited for the next nearby blast. \\u201cWhile we\\u2019re waiting for the next supernova , we have a lot of work to do. We need to improve the theoretical modeling to understand what features we could detect,\\u201d said Irene Tamborra, a theoretical astrophysicist at the University of Copenhagen. \\u201cYou cannot miss the opportunity, because it\\u2019s such a rare event.\\u201d Most supernovas are too far away from Earth for observatories to detect their neutrinos. Supernovas in the immediate vicinity of the Milky Way \\u2014 like Supernova 1987A \\u2014 only occur on average about once every half-century. But if one does occur, astronomers will be able to \\u201cpeer directly into the center of the explosion,\\u201d said Berger, by observing its gravitational waves. \\u201cDifferent groups have emphasized different processes as being important in the actual explosion of the star. And those different processes have different gravitational wave and neutrino signatures.\\u201d While theorists have now broadly reached a consensus on the most important factors driving supernovas, challenges remain. In particular, the outcome of the explosion is \\u201cvery strongly dictated\\u201d by the structure of a star\\u2019s core before it collapses, said Sukhbold. Small differences are magnified into a variety of outcomes by the chaotic collapse, and so the evolution of a star before it collapses must also be accurately modeled. Other questions include the role of intense magnetic fields in a rotating star\\u2019s core. \\u201cIt\\u2019s very possible that you can have a hybrid mechanism of magnetic fields and neutrinos,\\u201d said Burrows. The way neutrinos change from one type \\u2014 or \\u201cflavor\\u201d \\u2014 into another and how this affects the explosion is also unclear. \\u201cThere are a lot of ingredients that still need to be added to our simulations,\\u201d said Tamborra. \\u201cIf a supernova were to explode tomorrow and it matches our theoretical predictions, then it means that all the ingredients that we are currently missing can safely be neglected. But if this is not the case, then we need to understand why.\\u201d\",\"2746\":\"If you enjoyed the HD footage of NYC in '93 featured in my latest video, @Techmoan has a great video about the technology behind it: invidious.snopyta.org\\/watch?v=jiu0LPeL\\u2026\",\"5237\":\"[link] [comments]\",\"4242\":\"When I search for Complex Cu-ions I keep finding [Cu(H2O)6]2+, however I know that [Cu(H2O)4]2+ is also possible.

We take for granted the smooth ride through the solar system and the seamless sunsets afforded by the planet\\u2019s rotational symmetry. A round Earth also makes it easy to figure out the fastest way to get from point A to point B: Just travel along the circle that goes through those two points and cuts the sphere in half. We use these shortest paths, called geodesics, to plan airplane routes and satellite orbits. But what if we lived on a cube instead? Our world would wobble more, our horizons would be crooked, and our shortest paths would be harder to find. You might not spend much time imagining life on a cube, but mathematicians do: They study what travel looks like on all kinds of different shapes. And a recent discovery about round trips on a dodecahedron has changed the way we view an object we\\u2019ve been looking at for thousands of years. Finding the shortest round trip on a given shape might seem as simple as picking a direction and walking in a straight line. Eventually you\\u2019ll end up back where you started, right? Well, it depends on the shape you\\u2019re walking on. If it\\u2019s a sphere, yes. (And, yes, we\\u2019re ignoring the fact that the Earth isn\\u2019t a perfect sphere and its surface isn\\u2019t exactly smooth.) On a sphere, straight paths follow \\u201cgreat circles,\\u201d which are geodesics like the equator. If you walk around the equator, after about 25,000 miles you\\u2019ll come full circle and end up right back where you started. On a cubic world, geodesics are less obvious. Finding a straight path on a single face is easy, since each face is flat. But if you were walking around a cubic world, how would you continue to go \\u201cstraight\\u201d when you reached an edge? There\\u2019s a fun old math problem that illustrates the answer to our question. Imagine an ant on one corner of a cube who wants to get to the opposite corner. What\\u2019s the shortest path on the surface of the cube to get from A to B? You could imagine lots of different paths for the ant to take. But which is the shortest? There\\u2019s an ingenious technique for solving the problem. We flatten out the cube! If the cube were made of paper, you could cut along the edges and flatten it out to get a \\u201cnet\\u201d like this. In this flat world, the shortest path from A to B is easy to find: Just draw a straight line between them. To see what our cube-world geodesic looks like, just put the cube back together. Here\\u2019s our shortest path. Flattening out the cube works because each face of the cube is itself flat, so nothing gets distorted as we unfold along the edges. (A similar attempt to \\u201cunfold\\u201d a sphere like this wouldn\\u2019t work, as we can\\u2019t flatten out a sphere without distorting it.) Now that we have a sense of what straight paths look like on a cube, let\\u2019s revisit the question of whether we can walk along any straight path and eventually end up back where we started. Unlike on the sphere, not every straight path makes a round trip on a cube. But round trips do exist \\u2014 with a catch. Notice that the ant could continue along the path we mapped out above and end up back where it started. On a cube, coming full circle produces a path that looks more like a rhombus. In following this round-trip path, the ant has to pass through another vertex (point B) before returning to its starting point. That\\u2019s the catch: Every straight path that starts and ends on the same vertex must pass through another vertex of the cube. This turns out to be true for four of the five Platonic solids. On the cube, tetrahedron, octahedron and icosahedron, any straight path that starts and ends on the same vertex must pass through some other vertex along the way. Mathematicians proved this five years ago, but the dodecahedron wasn\\u2019t on their list. We\\u2019ll return to that later. To get a sense of why this fact about geodesics is true on four of the five Platonic solids, we\\u2019ll take a \\u201ctumbling\\u201d approach to these paths, and we\\u2019ll switch over to a tetrahedral world where tumbling paths are a little easier to study. Imagine starting from a vertex of a tetrahedron and heading out on a straight path along a face. Let\\u2019s orient our tetrahedron so that our path starts on the bottom face. When we meet an edge, we will roll the tetrahedron over, so that our path continues on the face that ends up on the bottom: This tumbling diagram gives us a way to track our path just as we did on the net of the cube: The tumbling path above represents this path on the surface of the tetrahedron: Here the five tumbles of the tetrahedron correspond to the additional five faces traversed by the path. Now we can imagine any path on the surface of the tetrahedron as a path in this tumbling space. Let\\u2019s call our starting point A and see where this point ends up after some tumbling. As our path leaves from A, the tetrahedron tumbles over the opposite side. This lifts A off the ground. Vertex A is temporarily suspended above our tumbling space. We wouldn\\u2019t normally indicate A\\u2019s location when creating our tumbling space, but here\\u2019s where it would appear if we were looking down. As the path continues, the tetrahedron tumbles again. There are two directions it could go, but either way A ends up back on the ground. As we let the tetrahedron tumble away in every possible direction, we end up with a tumbling space that looks like this: This creates a grid system because of the way the equilateral triangular faces of the tetrahedron fit together. This grid system tells us two interesting things about our tumbling space. First, the points where vertices of the tetrahedron can land are all \\u201clattice points,\\u201d or points with integer coordinates. That\\u2019s because one unit in our coordinate system is one edge length of our tetrahedron. Second, take a look at where A can end up. The coordinates of A are always even. Whenever A is on the ground, it will be back on the ground two tumbles later, so the possible landing spots for A are all spaced out by two edge lengths in each tumbling direction. Now let\\u2019s see what this says about geodesics. Recall that a path on the tetrahedron that starts and ends at A will be a straight line segment in the tumbling space starting at the A at (0,0) and ending at another A. And when the starting and ending points of the path are both A\\u2019s, there\\u2019s something quite interesting about the midpoint of the path. Even in our crooked coordinate system the standard midpoint formula still works, so we can find the coordinates of our midpoint by averaging the coordinates of the endpoints. Since the coordinates of the starting point are both 0 and the coordinates of the ending point are both even, the coordinates of our midpoint are both integers. This makes the midpoint a lattice point, and as we observed above, it therefore corresponds to a vertex of the triangle in the tumbling space. For example, the path from (0,0) to (4,2) has midpoint (2,1), a lattice point in our grid. That means that on the surface of the tetrahedron, this path from A to itself must pass through another vertex along the way. Since every possible landing spot for A has even coordinates in this system, the midpoint of every geodesic path starting and ending at A will correspond to a lattice point. This shows that every geodesic from A to A on the surface of the tetrahedron must pass through another vertex. This is a simple version of an argument that was made rigorous in 2015 by the mathematicians Diana Davis, Victor Dods, Cynthia Traub and Jed Yang. They used a similar but much more complicated argument to prove the same for the cube. Dmitry Fuchs proved the results for the octahedron and icosahedron the next year. Because of this, we know that for the tetrahedron, cube, octahedron and icosahedron, there are no straight paths going from a vertex back to itself that don\\u2019t pass through another vertex. But the existence of such paths on the surface of the dodecahedron remained an open question until 2019, when the mathematicians Jayadev Athreya, David Aulicino and Patrick Hooper proved it was actually possible. In fact, they found infinitely many straight paths on the surface of the dodecahedron that start and end on the same vertex without passing through any others. Here\\u2019s one shown on the net of the dodecahedron, hiding in plain sight. For thousands of years the Platonic solids have been studied together because they have so much in common. But now we know something new about the dodecahedron that is decidedly different. This mysterious discovery shows that no matter how well we understand mathematical objects, there\\u2019s always more to learn. It also shows that the path from problem to solution won\\u2019t always look like a straight line. Exercises 1. If the cube has edge length 1, how long is the ant\\u2019s shortest path from vertex to opposing vertex? 2. Explain why the diagram below could not be the tumbling path for a path on the cube. 3. One complication with tumbling paths of the cube is that point A doesn\\u2019t have a unique end position associated with a given ending location of the cube. For example, even though the cube ends up in the same location tumbling along either the red path or the blue one, point A ends up in different positions. Determine where A ends up after tumbling along the red path and the blue path. 4. Here\\u2019s a valid tumbling path for a path on the cube. Sketch the path on the surface of a cube starting at A. Answers Click for Answer 1: The path is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length 1 and 2. According to the Pythagorean theorem, the length of AB is $latex \\\\sqrt{5}$. Click for Answer 2: If a path forces the cube to initially tumble twice to the right, then its \\u201cslope\\u201d is at most 1 cube up per two cubes right. After the first tumble up, the highest the path could reach is halfway up the side, which would force the next tumble to be rightward. This gives some insight into why tumbling paths of the cube are more complicated than those of the tetrahedron. Click for Answer 3: Acting this out with a Rubik\\u2019s cube or a die is helpful. Notice also that the blue route could not be the tumbling path for a path on the cube. Click for Answer 4: Correction: January 13, 2021 This column was revised to make clear that the five tumbles of the tetrahedron shown correspond to the five \\\"additional\\\" faces traversed by the path, as the path traverses six faces in total.\",\"5181\":\"So I just bought a laser measuring device for around $25. It seems to read down to 1\\/16 inch precision. Now I got curious and did the math to figure out what the round trip time for light to travel 1\\/16 inch and its around 1.0E-11 second. So what I am wondering is, how is that even possible to have a micro processor time something that fast. The fastest processor speed that I can find has a clock speed of around 8Ghz. Even if the cheapo components in my $25 laser measure is actually hitting those kind of speeds, the light would travel about 2 inches in one clock cycle, which would mean it could count in inches, not sixteenths. The math says it would need to be counting up around 1800Ghz to count with 1\\/16\\\" precision. (a 1\\/16\\\" distance equates to a 1\\/8\\\" round trip, and a 900Ghz clock will have a 1\\/8\\\" round trip per tick, but your precision is half your sampling speed, so you need at least double that, right? so 1800Ghz) Is there some other principle going on than simply timing the return trip of the light? The fastest transistors that I can find are in the 300Ghz range.

Video on QM of Atoms which may clarify some concepts: https:\\/\\/youtu.be\\/fP2TAw7NnVU Why do atoms combine to form molecules? The quantum mechanics of chemical bonds and chemistry. How is it that we can have so many chemical substances with only about 100 relatively simple building blocks, called atoms? This is because atoms are rarely found alone. They are mostly found in combinations with other atoms, through the process of chemical bonding. Why does this happen? Why is the universe not full of just atoms floating around? The answer to this important question lies in understanding the role that energy plays in the formation of molecules, and its roots in quantum mechanics. All natural systems tend to adopt a state of lowest energy. A marble at the top of a hill has high potential energy due to gravity. If given the opportunity, it will roll naturally to the bottom of the hill where it will have a lower potential energy. The hydrogen atom by itself will be in its lowest energy state, called the ground state. But when a second hydrogen atom is introduced, some things begin to happen. Both atoms are in their respective ground state. But as they come closer to each other, first, the electrons since they are both negatively positively charged repel each other, but the electron of hydrogen atom 1 also starts to get affected by the positive charge of the proton in hydrogen atom 2. Similarly the electron of atom 2 starts to get attracted to the proton of atom 1. So the electrons of each of the 2 atoms tend to get pulled slightly to the other one\\u2019s proton. And if they get close enough, the cloud begins to spread to the space between the two atoms. if the atoms get too close, then the protons begin to repel each other and push each other apart. So there is an optimal distance that the two protons prefer to be in. Shouldn\\u2019t the electron clouds be repelling each other, and not allow them to get anywhere near each other? No, there are other interactions that affect the energy of the system: To calculate the lowest energy of this two atom system, or molecule of hydrogen, we have to take into account: 1) The kinetic energy each atom 2) The potential energy between the two protons 3) The potential energy between the two electrons 4) The potential energy between each electron and each proton The sum of the possible outcomes of kinetic and potential energy of this entire system in quantum mechanics is referred to the Hamiltonian, represented by capital H. This Hamiltonian is an operator corresponding to the energy of the system, and once you plug it into the time-independent Schrodinger equation, you can solve to get possible values for energy. This is not a trivial equation to solve. But it can be represented for simplicity by the morse potential graph. The energy two atoms system is less than the energy of two separate one atom systems. This is the reason if a bunch of hydrogen atoms are near each other, they will naturally combine to form a molecule of H2 rather than float around by themselves. This sharing of electrons by two atoms of hydrogen is called a covalent bond. Not all atoms form bonds with atoms of their own kind, nor with just any other atom. All the substances strive to achieve remarkable stability by sharing or having magical numbers of electrons \\u2013 2, 10, 18, 36, 54, or 86 electrons in so called shells around the nucleus of atoms. These numbers correspond to the number of electrons contained in the 6 naturally occurring noble gases. These are inert elements because they already contain the number of electrons needed to form highly stable shells around the nucleus. Other elements strive to contain a full set of electron in their outer shell called the valence shell. Any element with an unfilled outer shell has a much higher chemical potential energy than these noble gases. But what's so special about these numbers? Chemists will say, all atoms strive to form a valence set of electrons. And this attractive force for atoms to share electrons in order to form a full valence shell, is balanced by the repulsive forces of their electron clouds and protons. #hamiltonian #schrodingerequation Quantum mechanically, it all has to do with potential energy of multi atom systems. The Schrodinger equation and the Pauli exclusion principle are the underlying principles.\",\"3256\":\"In 1972, Frank Wilczek and his thesis adviser, David Gross, discovered the basic theory of the strong force \\u2014 the final pillar of the Standard Model of particle physics. Their work revealed the strange alchemy at work inside the nucleus of an atom. It also turned out to underpin almost all subsequent research into the early universe. Wilczek and Gross went on to share the 2004 Nobel Prize in Physics for the work. At the time it was done, Wilczek was just 21 years old. His influence in the decades since has been profound. He predicted the existence of a hypothetical particle called the axion, which today is a leading candidate for dark matter. He published groundbreaking papers on the nature of the early universe.

The transition to turbulence sometimes involves a period doubling. Turbulence itself is chaotic motion, it is unpredictable and sensitively dependent on initial conditions. What surprised me is all the ways turbulent flow is useful to us. It is diffusive, meaning it causes mixing. This is useful in jet engines or rocket nozzles (which Destin studies) and is important to achieve in microfluidic devices, which are so small that turbulent flow is actually difficult to achieve. Turbulent flow can energize a boundary layer, which is important to maintain flow attachment over a wing, maintaining lift and delaying stall. Similarly a turbulent boundary layer over a golf ball reduces pressure drag allowing golf balls to fly further. This is the reason for the dimples on golf balls. Flow transitioning to turbulence in the wake of a bluff body can create periodic vortex shedding. This beautiful phenomenon can be seen in the von K\\u00e0rm\\u00e0n vortex street in clouds viewed from space. Turbulence is everywhere, in the air currents in a room, in your aorta, in the breaths you exhale, in oil pipelines and water pipes, in the flow over cars and ships and planes. Animals have evolved for it (like dead fish swimming up stream) and we have engineered our environment, our planes and golf balls for it. Laminar flow may be nice to look at (which is why we use it in decorative fountains) but turbulent flow does the real lifting.

Philip Randolph persuaded President Roosevelt to end discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin in defense-industry employment. Not long after, in 1941, Roosevelt issued executive order 8802, prompting several agencies, including the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics \\u2014 NACA, the precursor to NASA \\u2014 to begin hiring Black workers. That paved the way for Christine Darden, who earned a master\\u2019s degree in mathematics at a historically Black university in 1967 and was hired into NASA\\u2019s all-female pool of \\u201chuman computers\\u201d at the Langley Research Center. However, she soon discovered that her role as a mathematician was limited to performing time-consuming calculations by hand. To do the creative mathematical work she craved, Darden needed to recast herself as an engineer. Darden transferred to NASA\\u2019s male-dominated engineering division and later earned an engineering doctorate. She went on to lead the Sonic Boom Group of NASA\\u2019s High-Speed Research Program, though she never stopped thinking of herself as a mathematician. \\u201cDespite my doctorate, I probably have more of a mathematics background,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI really enjoy the story of what these mathematical equations do in the physical world.\\u201d Her groundbreaking work laid the foundation for a new era of research on experimental planes (known as X-planes) that NASA launched in 2016. The goal has always been to accelerate the adoption of quieter, greener, safer, faster and more efficient planes \\u2014 even supersonic ones, which travel faster than sound. The fundamental problem she worked on, the sonic boom, begins when an airplane pushes air molecules out of the way as it flies. This creates an invisible, cone-shaped pressure field whose tip is on the aircraft\\u2019s nose and whose sides surround the plane. The cone moves with the plane and emits a series of pressure waves that travel at the speed of sound. As the plane speeds up, these waves get closer together. Should the plane exceed the speed of sound \\u2014 dubbed Mach 1 \\u2014 the waves coalesce into a potentially destructive shock wave called a sonic boom. \\u201cIt sounds like a sharp thunderclap,\\u201d said Darden, who published more than 50 papers on high-lift wing design in supersonic flow, flap design and sonic boom prediction and minimization. Darden retired from NASA in 2007 after a 40-year career. She was featured in Margot Lee Shetterly\\u2019s 2016 book Hidden Figures, alongside Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson \\u2014 three Black women mathematicians at NASA who made significant contributions at pivotal moments in the space race. All four women were awarded Congressional Gold Medals in 2019 for their scientific contributions. Quanta Magazine spoke with Darden recently about her experience working for NASA, how to make fast planes quieter, and her surreptitious visits to speak with schoolchildren and Girl Scouts. The interview has been condensed and edited for clarity. Have you always been interested in math and science? My mother tells the story of giving me a talking doll when I was 5. She was disappointed because, instead of playing with the doll, I cut it open to see why it talked. I also helped my dad work on his car and change the oil. When girls were inside playing, I was in the street, bicycle riding, skating and racing with the boys. We lived in Union County, North Carolina, right outside of Charlotte. My mother taught in a two-room school. When I turned 4 , Mother took me to school with her. She said I could play outside, but who was I going to play with? I stayed and did the first grade work. , she promoted me to second grade. When did you turn to space and aeronautics? I was in high school on October 4, 1957, when Sputnik launched. I felt the country\\u2019s excitement that Russia beat us into space. Also, I attended college in Hampton, Virginia, near NACA. John Glenn\\u2019s parade rode by campus. So there was certainly that influence too. How did you first come to work at NASA? After graduating with my master\\u2019s degree in applied mathematics , I was hired as a data analyst in the high-speed aeronautics division. We were female mathematicians who helped the male engineers create documents about wing and airflow shapes for the military and airplane companies. The engineers had slide rules and mechanical calculators but didn\\u2019t like doing calculations. So the head computer assigned young ladies to do the work. It wasn\\u2019t creative, though we drew figures. I still have some of the French curves I was given to draw smooth lines through my data points. What was it like? Did you ever talk with the male engineers in those early years? Yes, I often did after getting an assignment. Once, an engineer asked me to complete his work by writing a computer program. It was an interesting assignment. When I finished, he said my program gave incorrect answers. I reviewed and ran it again. He laughed and said, \\u201cThat\\u2019s still not right.\\u201d I didn\\u2019t like the laugh. My work wasn\\u2019t wrong. I looked at the work he had done prior to giving me the assignment and found one sign error. When I corrected his mistake and ran the code again, the numbers looked good. Was he gracious? No. But he didn\\u2019t laugh anymore. Was that something of a wake-up call for you? Well, I later asked a friend why all of the men were in engineering and all of the women were in computing. I thought it was because we had math degrees and they had engineering degrees. But she told me that some male engineers had math degrees. I wanted to be in engineering. Men in engineering did research, gave talks, wrote and published papers, and got promoted. The women, on the other hand, followed the engineers\\u2019 orders. Sometimes they didn\\u2019t even know what they were working on. They didn\\u2019t give talks, weren\\u2019t recognized on papers even when they helped, and didn\\u2019t get promoted. During that time, did you know the other \\u201chidden figures,\\u201d or their work? Dorothy Vaughan lived down the street from me. She started in 1943, so she was 24 years ahead of me. Mary Jackson and Katherine Johnson were 15 years ahead of me. Katherine\\u2019s daughter was my classmate . Katherine and I sang together in church for 50 years. I went by her office a couple of times. I met some of the men who she worked with. However, I never read anything at NASA about what she or the others did as their work was really hidden. I learned about their work in Hidden Figures. So how did you end up escaping that smaller role in computing? I asked for a transfer to engineering, which my supervisor said was impossible. So I went to the director and asked why males and females with the same background were assigned different jobs. He said, \\u201cYou know, nobody ever asked me that question before.\\u201d I said, \\u201cWell, I\\u2019m asking it now.\\u201d Three weeks later, I got promoted to engineering. Did other women follow you? I talked to some of the ladies in the office, but they weren\\u2019t interested. Maybe they weren\\u2019t outgoing. Of course, Mary Jackson was outgoing. One of the engineers had suggested that she go to a segregated high school to get credentials so that NASA would let her work in the wind tunnel. She did that and worked in the wind tunnel, but never got promoted there. What was your first engineering assignment? My supervisor asked me to program the equations from a paper on sonic boom minimization. The authors had assumed an isothermal atmosphere \\u2014 \\u2014 but I put the real atmosphere into the code. Eventually, I published on the topic. I also started working on my mechanical engineering doctorate because I didn\\u2019t want anybody saying I couldn\\u2019t do that job. Once I finished the computer program, we input variables such as the airplane\\u2019s length, weight, altitude and Mach number. The output gave the equivalent area distribution . With that, we started designing planes. Did any working airplanes use your designs? In the wind tunnel, the difference in pressure inside and outside of the pressure cone had been much smaller for our design than for the baseline plane. However, we needed to fly over people to get feedback about how people would tolerate the minimized boom. Boeing ran a test flight over Chicago and Oklahoma City. Once they started, people called to report damage to sheetrock, windows and the good china in their homes. After that, the U.S. canceled the program and outlawed commercial supersonic flights over land. That law is still there. But supersonic transport remained very popular. Eventually, in the late 1980s, Congress offered money to address the supersonic boom\\u2019s environmental concerns, which include noise and the boom itself, but also possible ozone destruction. They asked that I gather everybody in the U.S. researching the sonic boom for a two-day national meeting at Langley. I led the design and operational plan of the research program . We did years of testing in our wind tunnels to show what worked. Then DARPA borrowed two F5 supersonic Air Force planes for a test around 2002 over the Mojave Desert. They built and pasted panels onto one of the planes so that it matched the equivalent area distribution from our computer program. The other F5 stayed the same. When the F5 with no changes was flown, you could hear people in the control room shouting because of the loud boom. But the demonstrator plane \\u2014 the one with the panels on it \\u2014 had a much softer boom. It worked! I retired shortly after that, but much later, in 2018, NASA gave a contract to Skunk Works, Lockheed Martin, to build QueSST \\u2014 a good, low-boom supersonic X plane. They\\u2019re working on it now. It has such a long nose that it uses external vision to land the plane. They expect the boom to sound like a thump. But what about the law prohibiting commercial supersonic flights? They\\u2019ll do flight tests and get feedback on the noise. Then NASA will present the data to the FAA to request a rule change. They\\u2019re also talking to other world noise agencies to change laws so that supersonic planes can fly around the globe. Another big legacy of your work \\u2014 the book Hidden Figures \\u2014 also happened after you retired. How did that come about? Margot\\u2019s father and I worked together, and we\\u2019d bring our children to Langley\\u2019s big spring picnic. So I first met Margot when she was a girl. Later, Margot was working on Wall Street but wanted to write \\u2014 her mother taught English and had worked with Margot on her writing. One day Margot and her husband visited her parents. They were riding to church when her dad said, \\u201cOh, look, Margot, there\\u2019s Miss So-and-so,\\u201d . \\u201cShe was a computer at Langley and your Sunday school teacher.\\u201d Then her dad talked about the Langley computers. Margot\\u2019s husband said, \\u201cWell, if the Langley computers did all that, how come I\\u2019ve never heard of them?\\u201d And Margot thought, \\u201cMaybe I should write that book.\\u201d That\\u2019s when she called me. Soon, it got so that every time she came to town, we had lunch. Once, I mentioned The Warmth of Other Suns, by Isabel Wilkerson, a book about Black migration patterns to the North and West told through three people. It was a great story and great history book. And so Margot put both personal stories and history in her book. Now you\\u2019re a public figure, often speaking to student groups and Girl Scout troops. Did you do this before the book? Yes, but when I first met Mary Jackson , she told me, \\u201cDo you know that I got a poor performance appraisal because my supervisor said I spent too much time visiting schools?\\u201d Remember, she never got promoted there. When she told me that, I said, \\u201cOK, the next time I go, I\\u2019ll tell nobody where I\\u2019m going. I\\u2019ll just say I\\u2019m going out for an hour.\\u201d Of course, within a few years they were giving awards for people who visited schools. In recent years, I\\u2019ve been talking to students all over the country. Invariably, the young women come up and say, \\u201cWe didn\\u2019t know women did work like that!\\u201d Girls need to know that women do this work.\",\"1427\":\"Get MagellanTV here: https:\\/\\/try.magellantv.com\\/arvinash and get an exclusive offer for our viewers: an extended, month-long trial, FREE.

Electroweak theory explained: At the moment of the Big Bang, all 4 fundamental forces were probably the same. But as temperatures and energies lowered, the forces separated into distinct interactions of their own. The energies at which electromagnetism and the weak force unite s something we can simulate in particle accelerators such as the Large Hadron collider in Geneva. But these two forces appear to be very different, so how do they unite?. Gauge bosons - like photons mediate the electromagnetic force, and the W and Z bosons mediate the weak nuclear force. The exchange of the virtual versions of these particles confer the appropriate force. So for example, when two electrons are near each other, their repulsion is due to the exchange of virtual photons. The weak nuclear force also works via the exchange of a virtual W or Z boson. In the beta decay of a neutron, one of its down quarks turns into a up quark by emitting a W- boson. This turns the Neutron into a proton. This W- boson almost immediately decays into an electron and an anti-neutrino. So what we detect in this decay is the electron and the antineutrino. The virtual particle is not detectable. The weak force is unique in this respect in that it is the only force which can change the identity of an elementary particle. One big problem in uniting the electromagnetic force with the weak force is the fact that photons are massless, but the W and Z bosons are very massive \\u2013 their masses are about 80 and 90 Giga electron volts or GeV. This is over 80 times the mass of a proton. American Physicist Sheldon Glashow had noticed that even though electromagnetism is millions of times stronger than the weak force at large scales, the strengths of both forces appeared to be identical at very small lengths \\u2013 about 1\\/1000th the width of a proton, suggesting a point where the two forces may merge as one. Glashow showed that an acceptable theory for the unification of the weak and electromagnetic interactions could be found where the two forces are treated together as one \\u2013 as an electroweak force. And his model predicted 4 bosons that would mediate this force. These bosons were called W1, W2, W3, and B. There were two problems with his model. First it predicted a third weak force neutral Boson, now called the Z boson, which was not predicted by any theory at that time. The other was that Glashow\\u2019s model only worked if all 4 Bosons were massless. One can call this masslessness, a kind of symmetry. But this did not fit observations. Something had to break this symmetry because the weak force was weak and interacted only at very small distances, indicating that its mediating bosons had to be massive. Glashow could not find the right mechanism for making the 4 massless bosons from his electroweak theory into the 3 heavy weak force bosons and the massless photon. Three years later in 1964, Robert Brout and Francois Englert in Brussels and Peter Higgs developed a mechanism whereby mass could be given to elementary particles while maintaining a meaningful theory. The Brout-Englert-Higgs (BEH) mechanism employed the properties of a field (what is now called the Higgs field) to break the symmetry, and it predicted another massive particle, the Higgs boson. In 1967 and 1968, Pakistani physicist Abdus Salam and American physicist Steven Weinberg took the ideas of the Higgs mechanism, and combined them with Glashow\\u2019s ideas to show how Glashow\\u2019s 3 weak force mediating particles could gain mass, while the photon of electromagnetism could remain massless, in the same theoretical framework. This is the basis of what is now electro-weak theory. #electroweakforce So now the question is, how does the Higgs mechanism give rise to masses in the 3 weak force particles, but not the photon. At energy scales above 160 GeV, the Higgs potential looks like a normal field potential, and does not confer mass. But at energies below about 160 GeV, the Higgs potential looks like a sombrero. That's why this is called the \\\"Mexican hat.\\\" The way the three Glashow particle interact with the Higgs potential determines the masses of the gauge bosons that we observe for the weak force (W+, W-, Z bosons), and for electromagnetism (photons). All 4 particles emerge from the same underlying principle.

How can positive protons be so close together in the nucleus, if they repel each other? Japanese physicist and Nobel laureate Hideki Yukawa sought to answer this question. He proposed the first significant theory of the strong nuclear force in 1934. He determined that this force must occur over a very small range. Yukawa proposed that there must be a massive mediator particle that transfers this force between protons and neutrons. Using Einstein\\u2019s energy equivalence principle E=mc\\u00b2 and Heisenberg\\u2019s uncertainty principle, he got a mass of 100 mega electron volts (MeV). This is close to what was found later to be correct -138 MeV. Yukawa coined the term meson for this particle. New mesons and other particles kept getting discovered. This created a crisis in particle physics because all particles could not be fundamental. In 1964, Murry Gell-Mann and George Zweig proposed that the various particles that interacted with the strong nuclear force could be explained if they were composed of fundamental particles called quarks. Gell-Mann said were three types of quarks - up, down and strange. And they all experience the strong force. The quark model proposed that mesons where made of a quark anti-quark pair. But another way quarks could combine is in groups of 3 quarks. These became baryons, such as protons and neutrons. A proton is made of two up quarks and a down quark. The neutron is made of two down quarks and an up quark. But one detected particle, a delta particle has 3 up quarks. This should be impossible because at least two of them would have the same quantum properties. And according to the Pauli exclusion principle, two fermions, with the same quantum properties cannot exist in the same location at the same time. This principle is the reason you can have only two electrons in any atomic orbital. In 1964, American physicist Wally Greenberg proposed that quarks must have an additional property called color. Color is not optical, it is a metaphor for a kind of charge, a color charge. This would make the quarks not identical, so they could exist in the same particle. There are three kinds of color \\u2013 red, green, blue. You have to combine these colors to get a neutral white color, just like when you combine the visible colors. Similar to the way electric charge is conserved in QED, in QCD, color must be conserved, that is, all the colors must combine to get a neutral white. But Pi mesons are only composed of two quarks. How do two quarks form a neutral color? There are anticolors called anti-red, anti-green, and anti-blue. When color, anti-color charges combine, they also form a neutral color charge. But no one had ever detected a quark by itself. Scientists came up with an idea called quark confinement to explain how quarks are confined to within the nucleon - protons and neutrons. This implied that there must be something strongly holding these quarks together within the nucleon. A new particle, called a gluon, must exist to confer this attractive force. Similar to the way QED, deals with electric charges and photons as the mediating particle for the electromagnetic force, QCD deals with color charges and the mediating particle called gluons. The difference is that photons are electrically neutral so they transmit the electromagnetic force, but they do not experience it The gluon, however not only transmits the strong force, but also has a color charge, so it experiences the strong force. Gluons interact with themselves. #quantumchromodynamics #QCD #strongforce As you pull two quarks apart, the strong force acts like a rubber band. The further you pull them apart, the more energy it takes. This tends to pull the quark back inside the proton or neutron. These gluon-gluon interactions constrain color fields to string-like objects called \\\"flux tubes,\\\" which exert constant force when stretched. But if a quark is pulled with enough energy it pulls away until the flux tube breaks. The energy expended in pulling the quark apart results in a newly formed anti-quark pair - a meson. Mesons are a form of matter-antimatter particle, which do not last long, and are unstable. The longest last for only a few hundredths of a microsecond. This effectively limits their range to within less than the diameter of a proton. One of the most important aspect of the strong nuclear force is that almost all the mass of an atom is due to QCD, not the Higgs field.

[link] [comments]\",\"4066\":\"More than a decade ago, plant geneticists noticed something peculiar when they looked at grafted plants. Where two plants grew together, the cells of each plant showed signs of having picked up substantial amounts of DNA from the other one. In itself, that wasn\\u2019t unprecedented, because horizontal transfers of genes are not uncommon in bacteria and even in animals, fungi and plants. But in this case, the transferred DNA seemed to be the entire intact genomes of chloroplasts. This posed a conundrum, because plant cells seal themselves inside a protective cell wall that offers no obvious way for so much DNA to get in. Now, researchers in Ralph Bock\\u2019s laboratory at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology in Potsdam have finally discovered the answer by capturing this transfer on video. Not only are cell walls sometimes more porous than was thought, but plants seem to have developed a mechanism that enables whole organelles to crawl through the cell wall into adjacent cells. The researchers reported their discovery in the January 1 issue of Science Advances. \\u201cThe real novelty is that they\\u2019ve shown the actual physical organelle is moving, not only from one cell to another,\\u201d said Charles Melnyk, a plant biologist who studies grafting at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences in Uppsala. \\u201cIt\\u2019s two different plants that are exchanging organelles.\\u201d Unexpected Holes in the Walls Farmers have used plant grafts since at least the days of ancient Rome to grow fruit trees and grapevines. Grafting a scion \\u2014 the flowering, fruiting part of a plant \\u2014 onto established rootstock can help young fruit trees or vines bear fruit earlier and improve their resistance to pests and disease. Grafting occurs in nature, too, when closely related plants that touch each other eventually fuse, or when parasitic plants form connections to their hosts. At the graft site, the plants form a kind of scar, or callus, that reestablishes the flow of water and nutrients through vascular tissues across the wound and sometimes gives rise to new shoots. About a decade ago, Bock and his team grafted together two species of tobacco plants and sequenced genes from both sides of the callus. They found that the whole genomes of chloroplasts had been exchanged between the rootstock and the scion. (Like mitochondria, chloroplasts and the other plant organelles called plastids are remnants of ancient endosymbiotic bacteria and carry their own genetic material.) In fact, the entire 150-kilobase chloroplast genomes had been transferred intact, not as naked DNA fragments haphazardly recombined among other genes. Accidental hybridizations or viral infections, which cause many horizontal transfers, couldn\\u2019t accomplish this. \\u201cThis is not what you would expect from a plant cell,\\u201d said Pal Maliga, a plant scientist at Rutgers University who has independently found genetic evidence for the transfers of chloroplasts and mitochondria inside grafts. Plant cells are armored with a stiff cell wall, so \\u201cmy image of a plant cell was the cytoplasm sitting in a cage, and nobody goes anywhere,\\u201d Maliga said. The genetic evidence for transfers posed a real puzzle: The only known openings in cell walls were the tiny plasmodesmata, narrow bridges (only about 0.05 microns wide) that allow adjacent plant cells to exchange proteins and RNA molecules. The chloroplast, typically about 5 microns in diameter, \\u201cwas way too big to move\\u201d through those, Maliga said. \\u201cIt looked like it miraculously showed up in the other cell.\\u201d The mystery persisted until Bock teamed up with his postdoctoral fellow Alexander Hertle, who had expertise in live-cell imaging and microscopy. Hertle was determined to look at what was going on in the callus. Examining thin sections of the graft with electron microscopy, he saw that the cells had openings larger than any previously seen. But even those, which were up to 1.5 microns across, seemed too narrow for the chloroplasts. Then, while observing live cells in the callus, Hertle caught images of the chloroplasts in the act of migration. Some of the chloroplasts changed into more primitive, more motile proto-plastids that could get as small as 0.2 microns. As Hertle watched, the proto-plastids crawled along the inside of the cell membrane to positions beneath the newly discovered holes in the cell wall. Budlike protrusions of the cell membranes then bulged into neighboring cells and delivered the organelles. As the tissue organization in the graft reestablished itself, the plastids returned to the normal size for chloroplasts. \\u201cSo there\\u2019s definitely holes in the cell wall that would allow the plastids to move through,\\u201d Hertle said. The dogma that a plant cell wall is a thick, more or less permanent barrier \\u201cbasically disappears with this study.\\u201d A Healing Exchange The metamorphosis of the chloroplasts isn\\u2019t well understood yet, but it seems to be a response to carbon starvation and less photosynthesis, Hertle explained. When the researchers turned off the lights, they observed that more plastids dedifferentiated, and the frequency of organelle transfer increased fivefold. How well the transferred plastids function in their new host cells depends on how closely related the two species are, Maliga says. If the genetic mismatch with the nuclear DNA is too extreme, the organelles may fail to work and will eventually be lost. But they could thrive in the cells of close relatives. Maliga suspects the proto-plastids might contain or produce signaling molecules that help the graft wound heal. The large openings that form in the cell walls also seem to be part of the plant\\u2019s emergency healing response to the wound at the graft site, but they may occur during some stage of normal plant development as well, Maliga says. Whole-organelle migration could help explain the observation that the chloroplasts from clumps of different species of beech tree growing near one another have more genetic similarities than chloroplasts from more widely spaced assemblages of beeches, Hertle says. The chloroplast-capture events also explain why researchers sometimes get inconsistent results when reconstructing the evolutionary histories of plants: Nuclear and chloroplast genomes may have different pedigrees. It\\u2019s not clear yet how frequently this kind of horizontal genome transfer through organelle migration occurs in nature. Perhaps plants move chloroplasts between cells routinely in response to injuries or other events; no one knows. Bock, Maliga and other researchers were able to document genome transfers only because the differences in the grafted tissues gave away what was happening. But if plants have evolved a mechanism for organelle transfers, then relatively rare natural grafting events may be only one occasion for them. Common or not, the phenomenon might have evolutionary or ecological implications. Hertle points out that once a mosaic cell in a graft callus starts to produce roots, shoots and flowers, it could give rise to a new species or subspecies, especially if cell walls open wide enough to admit nuclear genomes. In 2014, Bock\\u2019s team used this method to create a new species in the nightshade family with a combination of nuclear and organelle genomes that could not have arisen from hybridization. If nature offers an easy way to transfer organelles between plants, biotechnology researchers can put it to work in creating desirable new crop species. Although the potential applications are many, for Hertle nothing beats the joy of basic discovery. \\u201cThe thing that is very interesting about microscopy science is that you see things that you would have never thought existed,\\u201d he said.\",\"4390\":\"[link] [comments]\",\"4225\":\"What is the role of tracrRNA in Type II CRISPR?

And why is it one of the most important phenomena in physics? Quantum mechanics shows that quantum objects have a wave-particle duality. What we think of as an electron particle actually behaves like a wave, a probability wave. This means that its position is not a precise location in space. It is defined by a wave function that can only tell us the probability of finding it a particular location when measured. The wave function of a particle exists in all of space, in the entire universe up to infinity. So there is always a non-zero probability of finding the electron anywhere, including outside a barrier. We can attribute this behavior to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. It states that the uncertainty in a particle\\u2019s position times the uncertainty in its momentum has to be greater than a finite number. Practically this means we cannot know with 100% certainty what the position of that electron is. And the wave function of the electron, which gives us the probability of finding it at any location can be found using the Schrodinger equation. This equation was developed by Erwin Schr\\u00f6dinger in 1926, and it is the equation that describes the wave nature of matter. The Greek letter psi in the equation is the wave function. The wave function depends on both time and position. It can be both positive or negative, but the square is always positive. The square of the wave function as a function of position is the probability of finding the particle at that position. The Schr\\u00f6dinger equation is a statement of conservation of energy. It says that kinetic energy plus potential energy equals the total energy\\u2014But instead of just energies, we have energy operators acting on the wave function of the particle. For a particle inside a box with a wall of finite thickness and height, we can solve the wave function inside the box, in the barrier and also outside the barrier. We find that the amplitude is non-zero within and outside the barrier. So, it can has some probability of being outside the box. This doesn't work for large objects like a tennis ball because the wave function depends on several factors, like the thickness & height of the barrier, and the mass of the particle. For macro size objects, the mass is so large, and the thicknesses of the barriers so great that the wave function will have an extremely small value, making the probability extremely small. If you do a rough calculation for my hand to tunnel through the wall, the probability is about 10^-40 \\u2013 more zeros than atoms in my body (10^28). This is statistically though not physically impossible. Tunneling has huge implications in nature and technology. For example, transistors in electronic devices have a source on one side, and a gate to control the flow of electrons to the drain on the other side. If the gate is too thin, the electrons just tunnel straight though, ruining our circuit. This is why transistor can't get much smaller, which is a roadblock for developing better electronic devices. #quantumtunneling Quantum tunneling is responsible for the sun shining. Stars shine due to nuclear fusion. The sun fuses the nuclei of hydrogen atoms together to form helium. Tunneling is essential because hydrogen nuclei composed of positively charged protons repel each other. In order for them to come together, they have to overcome this extremely strong repulsion, called the coulomb potential. Because of quantum tunneling, the probability for this process to occur, becomes much more likely because the two nuclei can tunnel through this barrier. If it weren\\u2019t for quantum tunneling, most stars may never have ignited. The universe itself may have come to be because of Tunneling. The big mystery is what gave the big bang the kick that it needed in order to overcome the energy required to counteract attractive forces like gravity. This is not well understood, and not proven, but according to calculations made by physicist Alexander Vilenkin, the probability that the universe could overcome the energy barrier needed for inflation to occur and the big bang to result, is not zero even at the limit of the universe being size zero \\u2013 that is having no space and no time - a universe from nothing!\",\"2766\":\"The Riemann Hypothesis one of the most important problems in mathematics. invidious.snopyta.org\\/zlm1aajH6gY Find out why by watching this great explainer video by @QuantaMagazine and @AlexKontorovich.\",\"2750\":\"And Salvador Dal\\u00ed was alive until 1989.

He and Thomas Edison have arguably had more of an impact on modern technology than any other scientists. Tesla\\u2019s biggest contribution may be his innovations in alternating current technology, and the invention of the AC motor. The adoption of this technology was not easy because Thomas Edison\\u2019s direct current systems had been the standard early on. What is AC and DC, and why is one superior to the other? Atoms have a positively charged nucleus and negatively charged electrons surrounding the nucleus. But electrons in the outermost shell of the atom, called the valence shell, can sometime become free due to external forces. These electrons can move from one atom to another. This is what can cause a movement of charge, which is what electricity is. An electrical current is the flow of free electrons from one atom to another. The relationship between current, voltage, and resistance is described by Ohm\\u2019s law, Voltage = Current x Resistance Current (amps) is the rate at which the charges flow. It is analogous to the rate of flow of the water in a hose. Voltage (volts) is the force required to make current flow. It is analogous to the water pressure in a hose. Resistance (ohms) is a material\\u2019s tendency to resist the flow of charge. This is like diameter of the hose. The smaller the hose, the higher the resistance. DC is similar to the normal flow of water through the hose that we see. The water flows in one direction. AC is like the water flowing back and forth within the hose 50 or 60 times per second, 50 Hertz or 60 Hertz. This is where the water analogy is not so great, because water doesn\\u2019t flow back and forth in a hose. AC won over DC because of efficiency and power delivery. Power is like the volume of water coming out of the hose. The formula formula for power is P = I x V. The same amount of power can be transmitted either at high current and low voltage, or low current and high voltage. But one is better than the other. The longer this cable is, the more resistance there is in the power line. When you pass a current through resistance, you create heat, given by Joule\\u2019s equation for electric heat, Heat = I^2 R Heat is wasted energy, so it is crucial to minimize it. Since I = P\\/V, if we substitute it back into the heat equation. We see that Heat equals Power squared times resistance R, divided by voltage squared. We want to MAXIMIZE voltage V to minimize heat. In modern electric power grids, electricity is routinely transmitted for hundreds of kilometers at hundreds of thousands of volts. But voltage can't be this high when it arrives at your home because it would be dangerous. So, it has to be stepped down before it gets to your house. This is done via a transformer which reduces voltage from hundreds of thousands of volts to between 110 to 240 volts. This stepping up and stepping down of voltage is where alternating current is superior to direct current. Direct current cannot be easily transformed from low voltage to high voltage and visa versa, but alternating current can. And here\\u2019s the reason why: When alternating current passes through a coil, it produces a constantly changing magnetic flux, per Maxwell\\u2019s equations. If we put a loop or ring of iron through the coil, it can concentrate the changing magnetic flux to within the ring. Now if we wind another coil around the other side of this ring, we can create electricity and induce voltage within the new coil. The voltage created in the second coil is proportional to the number of loops we place around the iron ring. Using this method we can transform voltage from high to low and vice versa. But transformers like this require a time-varying voltage to function, so only alternating current works. In Edison and Tesla\\u2019s time, there was no easy way to transform voltage with direct current. Can devices work equally well with DC or AC current? Many devices\\u2014like light bulbs\\u2014can. Was DC really a losing concept? No. Most high tech appliances today that are powered batteries, like your laptop, cell phone, and iPad are all powered by direct current. #nikolatesla #currentwars Also, in the 20th century, engineers figured out a way to transmit electricity using high voltage direct current, or HVDC. HVDC is even more efficient than high voltage AC for transmitting electricity over very large distances, because smaller cheaper lines can be used to transmit the same amount of power, and there is less induction loss because no changing magnetic field exists with DC, unlike with AC. But the cost of DC transformers is millions of dollars vs. thousands of dollars for AC transformers. So HVDC is only cost effective for very long transmission lines.\",\"1424\":\"Get MagellanTV here: https:\\/\\/try.magellantv.com\\/arvinash and get an exclusive offer for our viewers: an extended, month-long trial, FREE.

Complex math, but physicist Richard Feynman came up with a simple way to view these interactions - Feynman diagrams. The 12 fermions are depicted as straight lines with arrows in the diagrams. The arrows represent the \\u201cflow\\u201d of fermions. No two arrows point towards each other. If time is in the x direction, then fermion arrows going forwards are matter particles, and those going backwards, antimatter particles. All 6 quarks have color charges. All particles with color charges interact with the strong nuclear force. Quarks also have an electric charge, so they also feel the electromagnetic force. Leptons can be divided into the electron and its heavier cousins, the muon and tau particles. These all have electric charges but no color charges. Neutrinos do not have a color charge or an electric charge, so they are not affected by the strong and electromagnetic forces. All fermions carry something called weak isospin. This can be thought of as the \\u201ccharge\\u201d of the weak force. It can be +1\\/2 or -1\\/2. All fermions interact with the weak force. But weak isospin can also be -1, 0, and +1 \\u2013 the W- boson has a weak isospin of -1, W+ has +1, Higgs has -1\\/2, and Z boson and photons have a weak isospin of 0. Note that this zero is not the same has having no isospin. Everything in the standard model has a weak isospin except gluons. The weak force has the power to turn one particle into another particle. It is the only force that can do that. To recap, quarks interact with all forces, electron like particles interact with electromagnetism and the weak force, but do not interact with the strong force. Neutrinos only interact with the weak force and nothing else. Only quarks and gluons carry the strong force. Higgs bosons do not interact with photons or gluons. They confer mass to fundamental particles, so all fundamental particles with mass interact with Higgs. The simplest force is electromagnetic which interacts with quarks and leptons. Repulsion is depicted in M\\u00f8ller scattering. Attraction is shown in Bhabha scattering. When electrons and positrons are near each other, they can annihilate or attract each other.' Weak force is felt by all of the standard model particles, except gluons. W-boson can do something very special. They can change the identity or flavor of the particle - a neutron to a proton. We probably would not exist without it. Z-boson has no electric charge and can mediate interactions with electrically neutral particles like the neutrino and the Higgs. The strong force is the most complicated mathematically, but since it only relates to quarks and gluons. A pair of quarks can change color. This happens all the time inside protons and neutrons, and is the glue that binds the quarks together. Because gluons themselves contain color charges, they also interact with each other via complicated diagrams. This is what flux tubes are made of. These tubes are formed when you try to pull quarks apart. Mesons are formed when a quark tries to leave a nucleon. These mesons are a combination of a quark, anti-quark pairs which mediate the strong force between protons and neutrons. Pi mesons exchanges colors and quarks between protons and neutron. This is what keeps them glued together. Color charges must be conserved. Either red, blue, and green must combine, or color anti-color must combine to form a neutral color charge. The most prominent process used at the Large hadron collider to make a Higgs boson is called the gluon fusion process. During high energy proton-proton collisions, two high energy gluons can be produced. Strong force interaction can turn these into top quarks which fuse together via a loop of top quark, anti-top quark creation and annihilation. The energy of this can create a Higgs boson. #particlephysics #fundamentalforces When particles decay, they tend to decay into the next highest mass particle. Top quark has the highest mass of all elementary particles. Higgs boson has the second highest mass.

Rocket Science and orbital mechanics of Satellites. There are about 3000 operational satellites, owned by over 100 different countries orbiting the earth right now. About 550 of these are in geo stationary orbits - the satellite appears stationary compared to the rotation of the earth. Communications satellites are typically in such orbits. These allow you to leave your satellite dish in one position, and never have to change it. Orbital mechanics is rooted in Keppler\\u2019s laws of planetary motion & Newton\\u2019s laws of universal gravitation. These laws allow us to calculate the period and speed of such a satellite. Speed = S = sq root(mu\\/r) mu= standard gravitational parameter Period = T = 2pi*sq root(r^3\\/mu) r = radius of orbit = altitude + radius of earth mu = Newton\\u2019s universal gravitational constant x mass of planet A geostationary orbit is 35,786 km from the equator. The orbital period is 23.93 hours, or 23 hours 56 minutes which is the time it actually takes for the earth to complete one rotation. The reason we normally count 24 hours as being one day, is because 24 hours is the precise time the sun is at the same spot in the sky every day. To got into its orbit, the satellite is launched on a rocket. In the United States, one workhorse rocket has been the Atlas V. It weighs 700,000 lbs at launch and can lift 28,000 lbs to geostationary orbit. The main engine is powered by liquid oxygen, the oxidizer and RP-1 \\u2013 which is form of kerosene, similar to jet fuel. Rocket engines are an application of Newton\\u2019s third law, for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. The combustion of fuel causes high pressure exhaust gases to be expelled at supersonic speed. The rearward acceleration of the mass of the fuel leaving the rocket nozzle causes the equal and opposite reaction of forward thrust powering the rocket upward. Maintaining a stable straight flight comes from swiveling the thrust nozzle to keep it stable. This is called gimbaled thrust. A geosynchronous orbit is achieved in stages. Typically, the rocket takes the satellite on its orbital altitude, but the initial orbit is elliptical. This elliptical orbit has to be changed to a circular orbit to become geostationary. The satellite continues on an elliptical orbit until accelerating the rocket at precisely the right time during its trajectory forms a circular orbit at the geostationary distance, which is at 35,786 km above the earth\\u2019s equator. There is no other geostationary orbit. Since there are 500 satellites at that altitude, the real estate is limited. This real estate at the geo stationary orbit is tightly controlled by an organization called, the international telecommunications union (ITU) which assigns each satellite a slot at this perimeter. In addition, unless the rocket is launched from somewhere in the equator, it will have an orbit that is not quite geo stationary because it will not be in line or in the same plane relative to the equator. So for example, when satellites are launched from Cape Canaveral, which is located at about 28.5 degrees north latitude, the orbit will be inclined 28.5 degrees from the equator. This has to be adjusted, in a directional change requiring fuel. Thus, it is beneficial for countries to launch their rockets as close to the equator as possible so that less rocket fuel is needed to make this adjustment. The first thing that happens after a satellite reaches its permanent orbit is that solar panels are deployed so that the satellite can have power to function. It orients itself relative to the sun and the earth, and establishes communication links. The main function of the satellite is to receive signals from earth mainly in the form of radio transmissions, amplify them, and relay them back at a different frequency back to the surface of the earth. The shift in frequency is used to prevent interference of incoming signals with outgoing signals. #geostationary #rocketscience #satellites Since radio waves are a form of electromagnetic radiation, same as visible light, they do not bend around the curvature of earth \\u2013 photons are too fast after all, the job of the satellite is to transmit radio waves over long distances. Otherwise, this would require a string of thousands of relay stations on earth to do the same task. Interestingly, a geostationary orbit is sometimes called the Clarke orbit, named for science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke, who wrote 2001-a space odyssey. Believe it or not, he was the first person to detail the usefulness of such an orbit in a story he wrote back in 1945.\",\"348\":\"We cover the literature on psychedelics and mental health, psychedelics as a potential treatment for schizophrenia (only lightly covered, see the blog post for the entire argument), and a rambling of ideas pertaining to these topics.

We'd like to take a moment to recognize some of these achievements. 1. A landmark proof simply titled \\u201cMIP* = RE\\\" establishes that quantum computers calculating with entangled qubits can theoretically verify the answers to an enormous set of problems. Along the way, the five computer scientists who authored the proof also answered two other major questions: Tsirelson\\u2019s problem in physics, about models of particle entanglement, and a problem in pure mathematics called the Connes embedding conjecture. 2. In February, graduate student Lisa Piccirillo dusted off some long-known but little-utilized mathematical tools to answer a decades-old question about knots. A particular knot named after the legendary mathematician John Conway had long evaded mathematical classification in terms of a higher-dimensional property known as \\u201csliceness.\\u201d But by developing a version of the knot that yielded to traditional knot analysis, Piccirillo finally determined that the Conway knot is not \\u201cslice.\\u201d 3. For decades, mathematicians have used computer programs known as proof assistants to help them write proofs \\u2014 but the humans have always guided the process, choosing the proof\\u2019s overall strategy and approach. That may soon change. Many mathematicians are excited about a proof assistant called Lean, an efficient and addictive proof assistant that could one day help tackle major problems. First, though, mathematicians must digitize thousands of years of mathematical knowledge, much of it unwritten, into a form Lean can process. Researchers have already encoded some of the most complicated mathematical ideas, proving in theory that the software can handle the hard stuff. Now it\\u2019s just a question of filling in the rest.

A bright yellow cloud billowed tens of thousands of light-years upward from the Milky Way\\u2019s flat disk, with a fainter twin reflected below. The structure was so obvious that it barely seemed necessary to describe it in writing. But \\u201cNature wouldn\\u2019t accept simply sending a picture and saying, \\u2018OK, we can see this,\\u2019\\u201d Predehl said. \\u201cTherefore, we did some analysis.\\u201d The results, which Nature published on December 9, have moved a decades-old idea from the fringe into the mainstream. In the 1950s, astronomers first spotted a radio wave-emitting arc hanging above \\u2014 or to the \\u201cnorth\\u201d of \\u2014 the galactic plane. In the decades since, the \\u201cNorth Polar Spur\\u201d has become something of a celestial Rorschach test. Some see the scattered innards of an ex-star that\\u2019s relatively close by. Others see evidence of a grander explosion. The controversy hinges on every astronomer\\u2019s major headache: Peering out into space, researchers have no depth perception. \\u201cWe see a 2D map of a 3D universe,\\u201d said Kaustav Das, a researcher at the California Institute of Technology. For decades, most astronomers believed that the North Polar Spur was part of the local galactic neighborhood. Some studies concluded that it connects to nearby gas clouds. Others looked at its distortion of background stars and inferred that it\\u2019s a supernova remnant \\u2014 a dusty cloud marking the gravestone of a dead star. Yet Yoshiaki Sofue, an astronomer at the University of Tokyo, has always thought the spur looked funky for a stellar debris cloud. Instead, he imagined the arc to be one stretch of a huge unseen structure \\u2014 a pair of bubbles straddling the galaxy\\u2019s heart. He published simulations in 1977 that produced digital clouds lining up with the spur, and ever since then he has told anyone who would listen that the spur actually hovers tens of thousands of light-years above the disk. He described it as an expanding shock wave from a galactic calamity dating back millions of years. But if Sofue was right, there should also be a twin structure to the south of the galactic plane. Astronomers saw no trace of this counterpart, and most remained unconvinced. Then in 2010, the Fermi space telescope caught the faint gamma-ray glow of two humungous lobes, each extending roughly 20,000 light-years from the galaxy\\u2019s center. They were too small to trace the North Polar Spur, but they otherwise looked just like the galactic-scale clouds of hot gas Sofue predicted. Astronomers began to wonder: If the galaxy had at least one pair of bubbles, perhaps the spur was part of a second set? \\u201cThe situation dramatically changed after the discovery of the Fermi bubbles,\\u201d said Jun Kataoka, an astronomer at Waseda University in Japan who has collaborated with Sofue. The new images have further cemented the change of opinion. They came from eROSITA, an orbiting X-ray telescope that launched in 2019 to track dark energy\\u2019s effect on galaxy clusters. The eROSITA team released a preliminary map in June, the fruit of the telescope\\u2019s first six months of observations. The map traces X-ray bubbles that stand an estimated 45,000 light-years tall, engulfing the gamma-ray Fermi bubbles. Their X-rays shine from gas that measures 3 million to 4 million degrees Kelvin as it expands outward at 300 to 400 kilometers per second. And not only does the northern bubble align perfectly with the spur, its mirror image is obvious as well, just as Sofue predicted. \\u201cI was particularly happy to see the southern bubble clearly exhibited, so similar to my simulation,\\u201d he said. Still, a full interpretation of all North Polar Spur observations remains complex; a nearby supernova remnant could have parked itself right in front of the X-ray bubbles by chance, for instance, giving both interpretations elements of truth. In September, Das and collaborators used state-of-the-art observations of distant stars to show that something dusty is hanging out about 450 light-years away \\u2014 a stone\\u2019s throw, by galactic standards. But the meaning of eROSITA\\u2019s mushroom clouds is clear: Something went bang in the center of the Milky Way around 15 million to 20 million years ago, around the same time hyenas and weasels were emerging on Earth. \\u201cI think now is done, more or less,\\u201d said Predehl, who spent 25 years developing eROSITA. What exploded? Based on the energy required to make the clouds so big and so hot, there are two plausible sources. One possibility is that a wave of tens of thousands of stars popped into being and promptly blew up, behavior familiar from so-called starburst galaxies. But the bubbles appear rather pure, lacking the heavy atomic shrapnel that a cohort of exploding stars should have peppered them with. \\u201cThe metal abundance is very small, so I don\\u2019t believe that the starburst activity happened,\\u201d Kataoka said. The alternative culprit is the supermassive black hole that sits at the galaxy\\u2019s heart. The 4-million-solar-mass leviathan is relatively quiet today. But if a large cloud of gas once strayed too close, the black hole could have switched on like a spotlight. While feasting on the hapless passerby, the black hole would have gobbled down half the cloud while energy from the other half sprayed out above and below the disk, inflating the X-ray bubbles and perhaps the Fermi bubbles too (although the two pairs could also represent separate episodes of activity, Predehl noted). Astronomers have long observed other galaxies that shoot out jets above and below their disks, and they\\u2019ve wondered what makes the central supermassive black holes in those galaxies churn so much more violently than ours does. The Fermi bubbles, and now the eROSITA bubbles, suggest that the main difference may simply be the passage of time.\",\"3052\":\"[link] [comments]\",\"5230\":\"[link] [comments]\",\"1382\":\"Subscribe for regular science videos: http:\\/\\/bit.ly\\/RiSubscRibe The Ri is on Patreon: https:\\/\\/www.patreon.com\\/TheRoyalInstitution and Twitter: http:\\/\\/twitter.com\\/ri_science and Facebook: http:\\/\\/www.facebook.com\\/royalinstitution and Tumblr: http:\\/\\/ri-science.tumblr.com\\/ Our editorial policy: http:\\/\\/www.rigb.org\\/home\\/editorial-policy Subscribe for the latest science videos: http:\\/\\/bit.ly\\/RiNewsletter Product links on this page may be affiliate links which means it won't cost you any extra but we may earn a small commission if you decide to purchase through the link.\",\"5173\":\"How does it remove hair etc without any need for me to physically do anything? [link] [comments]\",\"433\":\"Imagine packing all the people in the world into the Great Salt Lake in Utah \\u2014 all of us jammed shoulder to shoulder, yet also charging past one another at insanely high speeds. That gives you some idea of how densely crowded the 5 billion proteins in a typical cell are, said Anthony Hyman, a British cell biologist and a director of the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics in Dresden. Somehow in that bustling cytoplasm, enzymes need to find their substrates, and signaling molecules need to find their receptors, so the cell can carry out the work of growing, dividing and surviving. If cells were sloshing bags of evenly mixed cytoplasm, that would be difficult to achieve. But they are not. Membrane-bounded organelles help to organize some of the contents, usefully compartmentalizing sets of materials and providing surfaces that enable important processes, such as the production of ATP, the biochemical fuel of cells. But, as scientists are still only beginning to appreciate, they are only one source of order. Recent experiments reveal that some proteins spontaneously gather into transient assemblies called condensates, in response to molecular forces that precisely balance transitions between the formation and dissolution of droplets inside the cell. Condensates, sometimes referred to as membraneless organelles, can sequester specific proteins from the rest of the cytoplasm, preventing unwanted biochemical reactions and greatly increasing the efficiency of useful ones. These discoveries are changing our fundamental understanding of how cells work. For instance, condensates may explain the speed of many cellular processes. \\u201cThe key thing about a condensate \\u2014 it\\u2019s not like a factory; it\\u2019s more like a flash mob. You turn on the radio, and everyone comes together, and then you turn it off and everyone disappears,\\u201d Hyman said. As such, the mechanism is \\u201cexquisitely regulatable,\\u201d said Gary Karpen, a cell biologist at the University of California, Berkeley, and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. \\u201cYou can form these things and dissolve them quite readily by just changing concentrations of molecules\\u201d or chemically modifying the proteins. This precision provides leverage for control over a host of other phenomena, including gene expression. The first hint of this mechanism arrived in the summer of 2008, when Hyman and his then-postdoctoral fellow Cliff Brangwynne (now a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator at Princeton University) were teaching at the famed Marine Biological Laboratory physiology course and studying the embryonic development of C. elegans roundworms. When they and their students observed that aggregates of RNA in the fertilized worm egg formed droplets that could split away or fuse with each other, Hyman and Brangwynne hypothesized that these \\u201cP granules\\u201d formed through phase separation in the cytoplasm, just like oil droplets in a vinaigrette. That proposal, published in 2009 in Science, didn\\u2019t get much attention at the time. But more papers on phase separation in cells trickled out around 2012, including a key experiment in Michael Rosen\\u2019s lab at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, which showed that cell signaling proteins can also exhibit this phase separation behavior. By 2015, the stream of papers had turned into a torrent, and since then there\\u2019s been a veritable flood of research on biomolecular condensates, these liquid-like cell compartments with both elastic and viscous properties. Now cell biologists seem to find condensates everywhere they look: in the regulation of gene expression, the formation of mitotic spindles, the assembly of ribosomes, and many more cellular processes in the nucleus and cytoplasm. These condensates aren\\u2019t just novel but thought-provoking: The idea that their functions emerge from the collective behaviors of the molecules has become the central concept in condensate biology, and it contrasts sharply with the classic picture of pairs of biochemical agents and their targets fitting together like locks and keys. Researchers are still figuring out how to probe the functionality of these emergent properties; that will require the development of new techniques to measure and manipulate the viscosity and other properties of tiny droplets in a cell. What Drives Droplet Formation When biologists were first trying to explain what drives the phase separation phenomenon behind condensation in living cells, the structure of the proteins themselves offered a natural place to start. Well-folded proteins typically have a mix of hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acids. The hydrophobic amino acids tend to bury themselves inside the protein folds, away from water molecules, while the hydrophilic amino acids get drawn to the surface. These hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids determine how the protein folds and holds its shape. But some protein chains have relatively few hydrophobic amino acids, so they have no reason to fold. Instead, these intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) fluctuate in form and engage in many weak multivalent interactions. IDP interactions were thought for years to be the best explanation for the fluidlike droplet behavior. Last year, however, Brangwynne published a couple of papers highlighting that IDPs are important, but that \\u201cthe field has gone too far in emphasizing them.\\u201d Most proteins involved in condensates, he says, have a common architecture with some structured domains and some disordered regions. To seed condensates, the molecules must have many weak multivalent interactions with others, and there\\u2019s another way to achieve that: oligomerization. Oligomerization occurs when proteins bind to each other and form larger complexes with repeating units, called oligomers. As the concentration of proteins increases, so does the phase separation and the oligomer formation. In a talk at the American Society for Cell Biology meeting in December, Brangwynne showed that as the concentration of oligomers increases, the strength of their interactions eventually overcomes the nucleation barrier, the energy required to create a surface separating the condensate from the rest of the cytoplasm. At that point, the proteins are containing themselves within a droplet. In the past five years, researchers have taken big strides in understanding how this collective behavior of proteins arises from tiny physical and chemical forces. But they are still learning how (and whether) cells actually use this phenomenon to grow and divide. Condensates and Gene Expression Condensates seem to be involved in many aspects of cellular biology, but one area that has received particular attention is gene expression and the production of proteins. Ribosomes are cells\\u2019 protein-making factories, and the number of them in a cell often limits its rate of growth. Work by Brangwynne and others suggests that fast-growing cells might get some help from the biggest condensate in the nucleus: the nucleolus. The nucleolus facilitates the rapid transcription of ribosomal RNAs by gathering up all of the required transcription machinery, including the specific enzyme (RNA polymerase I) that makes them. A few years ago, Brangwynne and his then-postdoc Stephanie Weber, who is now an assistant professor at McGill University in Montreal, investigated how the size of the nucleolus (and therefore the speed of ribosomal RNA synthesis) was controlled in early C. elegans embryos. Because the mother worm contributes the same number of proteins to every embryo, small embryos have high concentrations of proteins and large embryos have low concentrations. And as the researchers reported in a 2015 Current Biology paper, the size of the nucleoli is concentration-dependent: Small cells have large nucleoli and large cells have small ones. Brangwynne and Weber found that by artificially changing cell size, they could raise and lower the protein concentration and the size of the resulting nucleoli. In fact, if they lowered the concentration below a critical threshold, there was no phase separation and no nucleolus. The researchers derived a mathematical model based on the physics of condensate formation that could exactly predict the size of nucleoli in cells. Now Weber is looking for condensates in bacteria, which have smaller cells and no membrane-bound compartments. \\u201cMaybe this is an even more important mechanism for compartmentalization, because they don\\u2019t have an alternative,\\u201d she suggested. Last summer, Weber published a study showing that in cells of slow-growing E. coli bacteria, the RNA polymerase enzyme is uniformly distributed, but in fast-growing cells it clusters in droplets. The fast-growing cells may need to concentrate the polymerase around ribosomal genes to synthesize ribosomal RNA efficiently. \\u201cIt looks like it is in all domains of life, and a universal mechanism that has then been able to specialize into a whole bunch of different functions,\\u201d Weber said. Although Weber and Brangwynne showed that active transcription occurs in one large condensate, the nucleolus, other condensates in the nucleus do the opposite. Large portions of the DNA in the nucleus are classified as heterochromatin because they are more compact and generally not expressed as proteins. In 2017, Karpen, Amy Strom (who is now a postdoc in Brangwynne\\u2019s lab) and their colleagues showed that a certain protein will undergo phase separation and form droplets on the heterochromatin in Drosophila embryos. These droplets can fuse with each other, possibly providing a mechanism for compacting heterochromatin inside the nucleus. The results also suggested an exciting possible explanation for a long-standing mystery. Years ago, geneticists discovered that if they took an actively expressed gene and placed it right next to the heterochromatin, the gene would be silenced, as if the heterochromatin state was spreading. \\u201cThis phenomenon of spreading was something that arose early on, and no one really understood it,\\u201d Karpen said. Later, researchers discovered enzymes involved in epigenetic regulation called methyltransferases, and they hypothesized that the methyltransferases would simply proceed from one histone to the next down the DNA strand from the heterochromatin into the adjacent euchromatin, a kind of \\u201cenzymatic, processive mechanism,\\u201d Karpen said. This has been the dominant model to explain the spreading phenomenon for the last 20 years. But Karpen thinks that the condensates that sit on the heterochromatin, like wet beads on a string, could be products of a different mechanism that accounts for the spreading of the silent heterochromatin state. \\u201cThese are fundamentally different ways to think about how the biology works,\\u201d he said. He\\u2019s now working to test the hypothesis. The Formation of Filaments Condensates also helped to solve a different cellular mystery \\u2014 not inside the nucleus, but along the cell membrane. When a ligand binds to a receptor protein on a cell\\u2019s surface, it initiates a cascade of molecular changes and movements that convey a signal through the cytoplasm. But for that to happen, something first has to gather together all the dispersed players in the mechanism. Researchers now think phase separation might be a trick cells use to cluster the required signaling molecules at the membrane receptor, explains Lindsay Case, who trained in the Rosen lab as a postdoc and is starting her own lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology this month. Case notes that protein modifications that are commonly used for transducing signals, such as the addition of phosphoryl groups, change the valency of a protein \\u2014 that is, its capacity to interact with other molecules. The modifications therefore also affect proteins\\u2019 propensity to form condensates. \\u201cIf you think about what a cell is doing, it is actually regulating this parameter of valency,\\u201d Case said. Condensates may also play an important role in regulating and organizing the polymerization of small monomer subunits into long protein filaments. \\u201cBecause you\\u2019re bringing molecules together for a longer period of time than you would outside the condensate, that favors polymerization,\\u201d Case said. In her postdoctoral research, she found that condensates enhance the polymerization of actin into filaments that help specialized kidney cells maintain their unusual shapes. The polymerization of tubulin is key to the formation of the mitotic spindles that help cells divide. Hyman became interested in understanding the formation of mitotic spindles during his graduate studies in the Laboratory of Molecular Biology at the University of Cambridge in the 1980s. There, he studied how the single-celled C. elegans embryo forms a mitotic spindle before splitting into two cells. Now he\\u2019s exploring the role of condensates in this process. In one in vitro experiment, Hyman and his team created droplets of the microtubule-binding tau protein and then added tubulin, which migrates into the tau droplets. When they added nucleotides to the drops to simulate polymerization, the tubulin monomers assembled into beautiful microtubules. Hyman and his colleagues have proposed that phase separation could be a general way for cells to initiate the polymerization of microtubules and the formation of the mitotic spindle. The tau protein is also known for forming the protein aggregates that are the hallmarks of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease. In fact, many neurodegenerative conditions, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinson\\u2019s disease, involve the faulty formation of protein aggregates in cells. To investigate how these aggregates might form, Hyman\\u2019s team focused on a protein called FUS that has mutant forms associated with ALS. The FUS protein is normally found in the nucleus, but in stressed cells, the protein leaves the nucleus and goes into the cytoplasm, where it forms into droplets. Hyman\\u2019s team found that when they made droplets of mutated FUS proteins in vitro, after only about eight hours the droplets solidified into what he calls \\u201chorrible aggregates.\\u201d The mutant proteins drove a liquid-to-solid phase transition far faster than normal form of FUS did. Maybe the question isn\\u2019t why the aggregates form in disease, but why they don\\u2019t form in healthy cells. \\u201cOne of the things I often ask in group meetings is: Why is the cell not scrambled eggs?\\u201d Hyman said in his talk at the cell biology meeting; the protein content of the cytoplasm is \\u201cso concentrated that it should just crash out of solution.\\u201d A clue came when researchers in Hyman\\u2019s lab added the cellular fuel ATP to condensates of purified stress granule proteins and saw those condensates vanish. To investigate further, the researchers put egg whites in test tubes, added ATP to one tube and salt to the other, and then heated them. While the egg whites in the salt aggregated, the ones with ATP did not: The ATP was preventing protein aggregation at the concentrations found in living cells. But how? It remained a puzzle until Hyman fortuitously met a chemist when presenting a seminar in Bangalore. The chemist noted that in industrial processes, additives called hydrotropes are used to increase the solubility of hydrophobic molecules. Returning to his lab, Hyman and his colleagues found that ATP worked exceptionally well as a hydrotrope. Intriguingly, ATP is a very abundant metabolite in cells, with a typical concentration of 3-5 millimolar. Most enzymes that use ATP operate efficiently with concentrations three orders of magnitude lower. Why, then, is ATP so concentrated inside cells, if it isn\\u2019t needed to drive metabolic reactions? One candidate explanation, Hyman suggests, is that ATP doesn\\u2019t act as a hydrotrope below 3-5 millimolar. \\u201cOne possibility is that in the origin of life, ATP might have evolved as a biological hydrotrope to keep biomolecules soluble in high concentration and was later co-opted as energy,\\u201d he said. It\\u2019s difficult to test that hypothesis experimentally, Hyman admits, because it is challenging to manipulate ATP\\u2019s hydrotropic properties without also affecting its energy function. But if the idea is correct, it might help to explain why protein aggregates commonly form in diseases associated with aging, because ATP production becomes less efficient with age. Other Uses for Droplets Protein aggregates are clearly bad in neurodegenerative diseases. But the transition from liquid to solid phases can be adaptive in other circumstances. Take primordial oocytes, cells in the ovaries that can lie dormant for decades before maturing into an egg. Each of these cells has a Balbiani body, a large condensate of amyloid protein found in the oocytes of organisms ranging from spiders to humans. The Balbiani body is believed to protect mitochondria during the oocyte\\u2019s dormant phase by clustering a majority of the mitochondria together with long amyloid protein fibers. When the oocyte starts to mature into an egg, those amyloid fibers dissolve and the Balbiani body disappears, explains Elvan B\\u00f6ke, a cell and developmental biologist at the Center for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona. B\\u00f6ke is working to understand how these amyloid fibers assemble and dissolve, which could lead to new strategies for treating infertility or neurodegenerative diseases. Protein aggregates can also solve problems that require very quick physiological responses, like stopping bleeding after injury. For example, Mucor circinelloides is a fungal species with interconnected, pressurized networks of rootlike hyphae through which nutrients flow. Researchers at the Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory led by the evolutionary cell biologist Greg Jedd recently discovered that when they injured the tip of a Mucor hypha, the protoplasm gushed out at first but almost instantaneously formed a gelatinous plug that stopped the bleeding. Jedd suspected that this response was mediated by a long polymer, probably a protein with a repetitive structure. The researchers identified two candidate proteins and found that, without them, injured fungi catastrophically bled out into a puddle of protoplasm. Jedd and his colleagues studied the structure of the two proteins, which they called gellin A and gellin B. The proteins had 10 repetitive domains, some of which had hydrophobic amino acids that could bind to cell membranes. The proteins also unfolded at forces similar to those they would experience when the protoplasm comes gushing out at the site of an injury. \\u201cThere\\u2019s this massive acceleration in flow, and so we were thinking that maybe this is the trigger that is telling the gellin to change its state,\\u201d Jedd said. The plug, triggered by a physical cue that causes the gellin to transition from liquid to solid phase, is irreversibly solidified. In contrast, in the fungal species Neurospora, the hyphae are divided into compartments, with pores that regulate the flow of water and nutrients. Jedd wanted to know how the pores were opened and closed. \\u201cWhat we discovered is some intrinsically disordered proteins that seem to be undergoing a condensation to aggregate at the pore, to provide a mechanism for closing it,\\u201d Jedd explained. The Neurospora proteins that were candidates for this job, Jedd\\u2019s team learned, had repeated mixed-charge domains that could be found in some mammalian proteins, too. When the researchers synthesized proteins of varying compositions but with similar mixes of lengths and charge patterning and introduced them into mammalian cells, they found that the proteins could be incorporated into nuclear speckles, which are condensates in the mammalian cell nucleus that help to regulate gene expression, as they and colleagues led by Rohit Pappu of Washington University in St. Louis reported in a 2020 Molecular Cell paper. The fungal and mammalian kingdoms seem to have arrived independently at a strategy of using disordered sequences in mechanisms based on condensation, Jedd said, \\u201cbut they\\u2019re using it for entirely different reasons, in different compartments.\\u201d Reconsidering Old Explanations Phase separation has turned out to be ubiquitous, and researchers have generated lots of ideas about how this phenomenon could be involved in various cell functions. \\u201cThere\\u2019s lots of exciting possibilities that raises, so that\\u2019s what I think drives \\u2026 interest in the field,\\u201d Karpen said. But he also cautions that while it is relatively easy to show that a molecule undergoes phase separation in a test tube, demonstrating that phase separation has a function in the cell is much more challenging. \\u201cWe still don\\u2019t know so much,\\u201d he said. Brangwynne agreed. \\u201cIf you\\u2019re really honest, it\\u2019s still pretty much at a hand-wavy stage, the whole field,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s very early days for understanding how this all works. The fact that it\\u2019s hand-wavy doesn\\u2019t mean that liquid phase separation isn\\u2019t the key driving force. In fact, I think it is. But how does it really work?\\u201d The uncertainties do not discourage Hyman, either. \\u201cWhat phase separation is allowing everyone to do is go back and look at old problems which stalled out and think: Can we now think about this a different way?\\u201d he said. \\u201cAll the structural biology that was done has just been brilliant \\u2014 but many problems stalled out. They couldn\\u2019t actually explain things. And that\\u2019s what phase separation has allowed, is for everyone to think again about these problems.\\u201d\",\"363\":\"GRANDIOSITY Difference, or beneath.

Is quantum mechanics responsible for consciousness and free will? There is a reductionist claim that the universe is a sophisticated kind of clock ruled by the laws of physics. Are we sophisticated automatons? But doesn\\u2019t this unpredictability of natural laws via quantum mechanics give us free will? Sir Roger Penrose tried to tackle this. Is there a quantum physics connection to consciousness that ensures that we have free will? Reductionism is the idea that any complex system is the sum of its simpler fundamental individual parts. Matter, energy, and the laws of physics that determine how they interact is all there is. Counter argument is that consciousness is somehow different. If a human being was nothing more than matter and energy, then what would be the difference between a person who is alive, and the same person immediately after his death. All the matter and energy of the person would not have changed. There seems to be one main difference \\u2013 consciousness. Rene Descartes proposed the idea of a malicious demon. Such a demon could take over his mind to create a delusion about the reality, that nothing may actually exist. Descartes said, there is one thing that even the evil demon could not delude me of, and this is my sense of existence. He said, \\u201cI think, therefore I am.\\u201d I can only be fooled if my mind exists, If my mind cannot be fooled about my existence, then my mind must be separate from my body. And this idea of mind-body dualism, is sometimes used to justify free will. There are 3 choices for how consciousness could arise. One is dualism. Free will is explained, but this would by definition, be supernatural since it is not subject to physical laws. Second is the materialism. Consciousness is a direct consequence of physical laws. But this view cannot explain free will. Third is that consciousness results from physical processes that are not yet fully understood, but is ultimately scientifically explainable. Roger Penrose embraced this third idea. He partnered with anesthesiologist Stuart Hameroff to show that some brain functioning is non-determinable based on the laws of quantum mechanics. Microtubules, made of proteins called tubulin, facilitate the delivery of neurotransmitters in the neurons of brain cells. Tubulin can switch between two states of phosphorylation and be in a superposition. If this is true then each tubulin molecule could act as a quantum bit or qubit. Consciousness is the result of the collapse of the superposed states of this tubulin. Penrose and Hameroff theory is called Orchestrated objective reduction, or the Orch OR theory. MIT physicist Max Tegmark said that the brain is too wet and warm for delicate quantum effects. Tegmark showed that any superposed state in microtubules would decohere within 10^-13 seconds. This is 10 orders of magnitude faster than the time it takes for any known brain process to occur. Matthew Fisher, physicist at Univ of California, Santa Barbara also showed that the temperatures needed to maintain superposition based on the frequency of neuronal firing is about 10^-7 kelvin, which is much higher than body temperature - 310 kelvin or 98.6 F. Fisher proposed a theory where quantum superposition could be maintained in the nucleus of atoms. Certain chemical reactions can produce spin correlated nuclei, where the spin of one nucleus is dependent on another. Since nuclei tend to be more isolated being in the center of atoms, the quantum correlation or entanglement, can be maintained for longer periods of time. He found that the decoherence time for phosphate ion is about 1 second, which is enough time for it to have an effect on brain processing. Such ions are found in ATP. Quantum behavior in the phosphorus nuclear spins could be protected from decoherence if the phosphate ions are incorporated into larger molecules called \\\"Posner molecules.\\\" The main theoretical argument against the quantum consciousness theories is that quantum states in the brain would lose coherency before they reached a scale where they could be useful for neural processing. #quantumconsciousness #penrosehameroff #orchor Physicists opposed to the idea point out the evidence from brain fMRI.

A force is conferred is through the exchange of virtual bosons. So for example in electromagnetism, an exchange of virtual photons results in an exchange of momentum which results in two like charges repelling each other. Gravity is missing from this picture because in General relativity, gravity is not a force, but is a curvature of space-time. The problem is that stars and planets are made of molecules, atoms and radiation. And the forces that hold the atoms together are due to discrete units of virtual particles. It is the exchange or swapping of these virtual bosons that holds or breaks up atoms and molecules. Quantum mechanics conflicts with general relativity, because QM treats every thing as being discrete, and GR treats everything as being continuous. We need a theory that combines the two because we live in one reality, not two different realities. This is why most physicists believe General relativity is incomplete. Why can\\u2019t quantum mechanics be the one that is incomplete? Of the 4 fundamental forces, 3 have very robust quantum mechanical theories. Only gravity lacks a quantum description. Quantum mechanics also has almost all of classical physics within in its limits. Classical physics like general relativity, does not have quantum effects. We have learned is that Quantum physics is the fundamental language of reality. One way to quantize gravity is to quantize space-time itself. This is what loop quantum gravity or LQG does. It shows that the fabric of space-time is not continuous, but is made up of discrete quanta, like the pixels on a TV screen. This is different than string theory, because in string theory, space is the background or the canvas, on which strings vibrate. This means that distance has a minimum quantity of 10^-35 m. Area has a minimum value of 10^-70 m^2, and volume has a minimum value of 10^-105 m^3 - below which it cannot go. Time also has a minimum quantity of 10^-43 seconds, or about Planck time. Space time is made up for finite loops with nodes connecting them. The nodes is where the quanta volumes of space reside. It has a volume that is a multiple of 10^-99 cm^3. The loops in between the nodes represent 2 dimensional areas. Large quantities of loops and nodes are called \\u201cspin networks.\\u201d Space is defined by the geometry of this spin network. Time is defined by the movement of this spin network. The spin network and quantum movements of time, is called a spin foam. Time ticks like a digital clock with each tick being 10^-43 secs. When mass and energy are added to this spin foam, the shape of the volumes of the spin network is distorted, distorting space and time. This distortion is what we perceive as gravity. LQG makes a testable prediction that photons of higher energy travel slightly slower than low-energy photons. But this has not been observed. A second way to quantize gravity is to theorize a completely new mathematical framework of reality based on a new understanding of fundamental particles. This is string theory. It replaces the fundamental particles with one dimensional fiber-like strings. Different vibrations of strings behave just like the elementary particles of the standard model. But the biggest problems is that these strings would need to vibrate not just in the 3 dimensions, but in at least 6 more spatial dimensions in order to mathematically account for the various particles. It does't appear that additional large dimensions in our universe exist, so physicists think that these dimensions could be very small and hidden from our perceptions. If you treat the universe as strings vibrating in 9 dimensions, a particular closed string vibration results in a graviton particle. So this would allow for the existence of a force-carrying particle for gravity just like the other 3 three forces. #quantumgravity #loopquantumgravity #stringtheory The promise of string theory is that all the fundamental constants, and properties of particles could come out of it. But 9 spatial dimensions is a problem. Another problem is that it requires the existence of super symmetry, where each particle has a shadow partner particle with different masses. No such supersymmetric particles have been found at the LHC.\",\"2034\":\"Apologies if there is a more appropriate sub, was unsure where else to ask.

However, they use a mouse model that has this molecule knocked out, and reintroduce it via intracerebroventricular injection. The IP ab treatment manages to ameliorate the loss of BBB integrity. This suggest that: 1) the antibody goes from the peritoneal cavity into circulation and reaches the BBB. How does this work? I could see drugs being passively transported into the surrounding vasculature, but I don't see it'd work for antibodies 2) once at the BBB, the Ab crosses the BBB and neutralizes its target molecule before it can break down the BBB (this target molecule should only be found within the brain).

But quantum theory had a high price - determinism. it introduced randomness. Events were not deterministic anymore but probabilistic. We don\\u2019t see this in our macro world because it gets smoothed out. Small things move at very high speeds. And so to describe them at velocities near the speed of light, Einstein\\u2019s Special relativity must apply. The integration of quantum mechanics with electromagnetism is called Quantum electrodynamics, or QED. QED replaces the classical theory of electromagnetism, which involves continuous electromagnetic fields and puts it in terms of discrete quantities. In 1928 the first big step to QED was taken by British physicist Paul Dirac, when he published the Dirac equation. It blended quantum mechanics and special relativity. His equation was similar to the Schrodinger equation. Psi which is the wave function is present in both equations. Dirac made a Hamiltonian, which is the sum of all the energy, in terms of space-time. It also has the terms MC^2, and p the momentum on the left side - from special relativity. Schrodinger equation treats time and space as independent coordinates, but Dirac integrated space-time, into the equation. There are some formulations that result in negative solutions. His equation was predicting anti-matter. No one had ever thought of that before. Dirac believed antimatter had to exist based simply on the math. 4 years later, 1932 the positron was discovered by American physicist Carl Anderson. Later, three scientists began formulating a quantum theory of electromagnetism based on Dirac\\u2019s equation, and formulated QED - Richard Feynman, Julian Schwinger, and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga. They won the 1965 Nobel prize in physics. The result was a Lagrangian. This equation holds information about the electromagnetic field and about whatever charged fermions one wants to investigate, like electrons and quarks. In the 19th century, it was thought that two electrons near each other would simply repel similar to the way that two like poles of a magnet repel. Paul Dirac and others showed that there is no continuous field, but that the forces are mediated by the exchange of discrete photons. When two charged particles travel near each other toward a colliding path, as they get close they will repel each other. In classical theory, this would be thought of as the particles repelling due to a continuous field. But in QED, the path can be simplified to look like a Feynman diagram. These diagrams were developed by American physicist Richard Feynman around 1949 and they help to intuitively understand the mathematics of QED. The direction of the arrow on the fermion line tells us if it's a matter, or the anti-matter particle. If the arrow goes forward in time (to the right), it is the matter, and if it goes to the left, it\\u2019s antimatter. From this simplest Feynman diagram, you can build all other diagrams for QED. The lines with the arrows represent fermions, and they must be continuous. This is because of the law of conservation. The same number of fermions coming into a process must also come out. Note that a photon is a boson, not a fermion. But if a positron and electron come in, and only a photon comes out, then how are things conserved? The reason is because a matter particle is considered a +1 fermion and an antimatter particle is considered a -1 fermion. So an electron and positron coming in works out to be +1-1 = 0, so the rule still works. The Key to understanding Feynman diagrams is to know that each diagram is really an equation. One of the simplest diagrams is where two electrons come in, two electrons coming out and a photon is being exchanged \\u2013 this equation has 7 components. Each of these 7 components has an associated element in an equation. Note that when two charged particles actually come near each other, they exchange many photons, not just one. Many different types of potential exchanges can occur. But by simplifying the equation to the exchange of a single photon, we can get a good approximation. The lessons from the development of QED were later used for the development of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) & Quantum Field Theories starting in the 1960\\u2019s, like elecroweak theory. #QED #quantumelectrodynamics Electromagnetism was the first force to be expressed in terms of a quantum field theory.. QED is electromagnetism expressed in terms of quantum fields.\",\"5228\":\"[link] [comments]\",\"355\":\"In this episode we cover quite a lot!

From my understanding, pentane (higher enthalpy of combustion) should have less energy \\\"wasted\\\" in breaking bonds, as pentane's reactants should have weaker (or less) bonds. However pentane's combustion has one extra O2 bond, so does that mean that pentanol's bonds are so much stronger (because of the OH) than pentane's to the point where even with the extra O2 molecule it takes more energy to break the bonds of pentanol's combustion rather than the bonds of pentanol's reaction? I know that there are also incomplete combustions, but my teacher told me that just by looking at the complete combustion I should see why pentane has a higher enthalpy. At least from my little understanding of chemistry that's the conclusion I reached but I'm not sure. Sorry for bad English, its not my first language and sometimes I express myself unclearly.
