Research shows that gratitude releases Serotonin and Dopamine-the happiness and reward chemicals in your brain, when we practice gratitude we are essentially strengthening the neural pathways of contentment and happiness-these can build lasting characteristics. Gratitude helps with anxiety by interrupting the cycle of constantly scanning for dangers. When we are in fear or scarcity mode, our brain turns on the FFF response, but when we think of gratitude, research shows that the hippocampus and amygdala are activated, these parts of the brain aid in emotion regulation and can help turn on that feeling of safety, contentment, and calm. That feeling of abundance. Basically gratitude practice is a way to regulate the autonomic nervous system, gratitude can turn on that parasympathetic response and reduce stress hormones like cortisol. When we regulate the nervous system, that has a big impact on reducing the symptoms of depression and anxiety.

Fit Tuber\",\"1256\":\"Seasonal Affective Disorder is a type of depression that is associated with changes in the seasons. (It also has the clever acronym, SAD). Or it\\u2019s called the Winter Blues. These symptoms often start in the fall and persist into the winter. With Winter SAD people feel less energetic and more moody, with symptoms similar to depression. It can look like: Losing interest in activities you once enjoyed, feeling sluggish, tired, or low energy, having problems with sleep, feeling hopeless, weight gain, or appetite changes and specifically in the winter, cravings for more food, especially high carb food. Around 20 percent of Americans (That\\u2019s like 65 million people) experience seasonal affective disorder. Now this disorder impacts people who are closer to the poles, because the amount of sunlight varies more dramatically with the seasons there, than near the equator.

The Three Granthis represent our grasping to the physical, social and conceptual worlds. This guided meditation walks you through the process of dissociating from these outer parts of who you are, which you are tied to by these inner knots of attachment. This meditation allows you to detach from the outer world, which is subject to change and therefore not Self. You can use this as an aid to meditation or as a powerful tool for falling asleep. First you are guided to dis identify from the body and the physical dimension, then the emotions and the energetic dimension, and finally the thoughts and the mental dimension. This culminates in the experience of inner silence and all-pervasive bliss (anandam). This guided meditation achieves this by progressively releasing attachment to the body, emotions and thoughts, thus allowing you to let go of the outer world and slip into deep restful sleep. There is no need to struggle falling asleep once you have discovered the incredible tool that is yoga nidra! In fact, a greater challenge may be to remain fully awake throughout the whole session.

Alternate Nostril Breathing, also called Nadhi Shodana, is an incredible tool for activating the parasympathetic nervous system which can restore balance - particularly if you are consciously, or subconsciously, living more in fight or flight mode - which is common in such uncertain times. We will introduce the powerful play of opposites in yoga asana as well, considering the ways in which we may join steadiness, or STHIRA, with ease, or SUKHA. I will guide postures today that are there not to discourage you, but to help you play with the concept of how to create a dance for both steadiness and ease, and one that is individual for you. I invite you to use this material to check in, learn, and grow. Remember, it\\u2019s not about being able to stand on one foot. Learn the process of centering yourself, and remember, it\\u2019s a process. If you fall, I will catch you. You got this.

Buy Mamaearth Vitamin C Face wash and Face mask - https:\\/\\/bit.ly\\/3ndF3Bg (Apply discount coupon FITTUBER21 to get 21% off) Buy from Amazon - https:\\/\\/amzn.to\\/3rryGwp For a modern woman, an integral part of her grooming kit is her makeup essentials. A primer, foundation, lipstick, kajal, mascara, eye liner, blusher and so on. But do you know what goes in making your favourite makeup products? Loads of harsh chemicals to say the least. Using such products on a regular basis prematurely ages the skin and causes myriad skin issues. But don\\u2019t worry. It is time to throw these toxic products away as I share with you the natural makeup products available in the Indian market. 00:58 - #7 Natural Make up Product - Foundation - Foundation is a liquid or powder makeup applied to the face to create an even, uniform color to the complexion and enhance the natural skin tone. 02:00 - #6 Natural Make up Product - Primer - Any make up generally starts with a primer. And rightly so, a primer smoothens the pores of the skin and creates an even layer on top of it for foundation to glide onto. So a good primer creates a solid base for makeup. 03:11 - #5 Natural Make up Product - Mascara - A few swipes of a mascara wand are generally used to give an instant awakened look naturally, even on those worst mornings. But wait a minute? Did I say naturally? Well, the harsh truth is that commercial mascara is nowhere close to natural. 04:23 - #4 Natural Make up Product - Blusher - Cheek tints give that final edge to a well finished look offering a lustrous healthy glow to the cheeks. 05:18 - #3 Natural Make up Product - Kajal - Applying natural kajal to newborns and women is practiced in India since ages. Wearing kajal not just adds beauty to the eyes but also protects them from diseases. 06:47 - #2 Natural Make up Product - Eyeliner - Eyeliner is another product that finds a place in a woman\\u2019s makeup kit. Its primary purpose is to make the eye lashes look lush. 07:31 - #1 Natural Make up Product - Lipstick - Lipstick is something women wear daily all day long - sometimes even to bed. Many lipsticks contain heavy metals in their contaminated form.

Well, to get an answer I did examine many of our ancient Ayurvedic scriptures and have also had conversations with multiple top notch modern medical doctors to understand both the perspectives. While modern medical experts offer no solution other than human growth hormone injections on the other hand Ayurveda has a set of simple practices through which 100s and 1000s have already grown taller. Where modern science broadly suggests healthy diet and daily exercise, Ayurveda on the other hand goes much deeper to identify certain foods and herbs in nature that directly impact the height. It may be a hard pill to swallow for many modern doctors but Ayurveda clearly states that irrespective of your genetics, if you are under 21 years of age, all you need is a few simple ingredients, conviction in your mind and a strong will power to shoot up your height. And that\\u2019s what this video is all about.

So I used the example of being afraid of dogs and then explained how gradual exposure can help you overcome that fear by gradually spending time with dogs. But of course, when making a video about anxiety, the anxious people watching the video are going to say- but how can I do that, what if the dog bites you? Many people with anxiety focus on the worst-case scenario, instead of focusing on the potential for growth and healing. And that\\u2019s because when your brain is in anxiety mode, it\\u2019s attuned to threats, it only notices and pays attention to the potential dangers around you. But dogs can actually be dangerous. So when you\\u2019re in anxiety mode the 1 in 1,000 chance of being bit by a family\\u2019s pet dog feels like a serious, immediate, most likely occurrence. In Anxiety mode our brain is going to assume the worst about so many things- \\u201cWhat if they all hate me?\\u201d \\u201cWhat if I get Covid from my groceries?\\u201d \\u201cWhat if the car swerves into my lane?\\u201d It\\u2019s so easy to get wrapped up in all the \\u201cWhat-ifs\\u201d that you completely lose sight of your goals. Like overcoming anxiety, or visiting your son who has a dog. But there are some practical steps you can take to manage your brilliantly anxious brain instead of letting anxiety run your life. First realize that your brain\\u2019s most natural job is to \\u201cprevent dying\\u201d to keep you from bad things happening. And unlike other mammals, that are mostly instinctual about these things, running from an immediate threat like a tiger, and then relaxing when the threat is gone. Our brain has the ability to imagine danger in the future, remember danger in the past, and that makes us feel like we\\u2019re in danger in the present moment. But just because our brain is really good at imagining dangers, doesn\\u2019t mean that avoiding those fears is the way for us to live a good, happy life.

When something goes wrong, it tells us through a bunch of signs and signals. All we need is to be smart enough to understand those signals. Although, if not acted upon, these seemingly small issues can give rise to chronic health problems. In this video I am going to share with you over 31 more common signs and signals along with their effective solutions. 00:39 - Do you have a small crack at the tip of your tongue? See how tongue is related to the internal organs. 01:09 - Do you have small red dots or bumps on your tongue? Or your tongue is reddish in colour. 01:45 - Check if you have teeth marks on your tongue? It is a sign of malabsorption of nutrients in the body. 02:!9 - Pull your tongue out and if after a few seconds, if it trembles or quivers uncontrollably or is there a deep line down the centre of your tongue? 03:23 - Stretch your tongue out. Are you able to to move it on all side with ease or you find it difficult? 03:49 - Health issues associated with a shiny tongue. 04:13 - Do you have a thick large tongue which you believe to be larger for your mouth? 04:46 - Do you have a pale tongue? 05:07 - Does your tongue have a bluish purple tinge all over or on some parts? 05:30 - Do you have a patchy tongue?

Chewing on the philosophy of yoga and dropping in to wherever you are today, we continue to put the puzzle together, remembering all the wonderful vocabulary we have learned together thus far. The practice of renewal is powerful! It is one of my superpowers for sure. Anytime I find myself in the struggle zone, I slowly pull this practice out of my tool belt, and find my way back to center with a reverence for both the struggle - and my ability to make my way out to move\\u2026 forward.

This focus on survival was imperative to our ancestors, but in today's world, if left unchecked, it can lead to stress, burnout, and depression. But I have good news. There is a simple way to combat this challenge of focusing on the negative, and to turn up the volume of the positive things in your life.

Fit Tuber\",\"1118\":\"Become a channel patron: Patreon.com\\/sridevidas Everything you experience during yoga nidra and meditation is an aspect of yourself, however these parts of ourselves are impermanent, subject to change and therefore not the everlasting Self. As we identify more with being that formless inner experiencer rather than the forms being experienced we can allow whatever repressed nervous tensions there may be to become illumined with awareness and purged from the psyche. The first stage of yoga nidra involves relaxing deeper than what might be usual for you, therefore releasing muscles where you are subconsciously clenching and holding on to nervous tension. From the release of these muscles where nervous tension is stored the energy of that repressed samskara is liberated and comes to the surface of the gross consciousness to be expressed. The key to remember whenever an unpleasant energy begins to manifest during yoga nidra is to avoid repressing it, but also don't indulge in it from the first person perspective; but rather dissociate from it, identify it as not self, subject to change and impermanent. By diffusing the egocentric tendency to see these inner experiences as being 'you', they lose their psycho-emotional stigma and can be divested of the prana that was keeping them repressed. In this manner we gradually purify the contents of the subconscious mind by releasing the deep seated tensions, incongruences and conflicting beliefs, memories, desires and thought forms. This allows you to progress in deepening your level of relaxation each time you practice yoga nidra allowing you to eventually enter the highest state of yoga nidra, sleepless sleep.
