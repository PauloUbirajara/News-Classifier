forums video platforms social media q sites providing us data read watch otherwise consume consumers web though search engines voice assistants pricing bots even link preview bots performing staggering number requests every day—computer systems like playing ever-growing role data consumption tim berners-lee coined concept “ semantic web ” web considered global database computer systems could understand rather series separate web pages turn could effectively allow deeper integrations different computer systems allow greater decentralization data data large corporations—it data data data control manage websites unfortunately stage full data utopia large amounts data publicly available data available often locked behind apis proprietary systems need pay access building semantic web move full semantic web something happen overnight building web pages years html css javascript optimally designed human viewing experience extract reliable data html currently computer systems need able process unstructured data establish context meaning thing humans determine context meaning viewing page machines perform additional processing get context directly encoding structured data eliminates additional complexity machines process many different solutions encode structured data including open graph microdata rdfa json-ld open graph created facebook popular format holding specific types structured data facebook uses generate link previews page metadata website developers want additional control displayed based described metadata since creation social media sites also adopted open graph generating link previews microdata rdfa json-ld however bit different represent different formats storing data web page computers parse standardized structures however unless knows type data represented actually understand data missing shared vocabulary two different computer systems understand joint effort made google microsoft yahoo yandex proposed solution called schema.org promote structured data web pages common vocabulary search engines structured data help provide richer information search results schema.org describe every type object intend create solid foundation describe many common objects books events locations medical conditions movies organizations people areas cover alternative vocabularies used describe specialized data popularity enhancing seo schema.org ever-growing user base turn helps grow semantic web data could change use web semantic web may change think searching information online controls information imagine every website wall content graph inter-related topics ideas would need central spot data stored controlled single entity helping avoid concerns censorship bias simultaneously improving privacy control one ’ data share example take site like facebook maintains mountains information people businesses various relationships different entities comments reactions shares data part facebook ecosystem effectively “ belongs ” future data control sites like facebook could visual representation existing network built semantic web data declare public website viewed giving us full control shared also means locked-in service like facebook free move “ front ends ” data maintain might seem strange organization like facebook would ever want give data however stricter laws passed example gdpr eu ccpa california may matter time facebook forced new technologies built take advantage data also provide new tools experiences users algorithms behind search engines complex currently provide results queries already specifically answered asked “ songs 1995 failed domestically well-received worldwide ” would unlikely get results one yet answered question data query exists web however readily available due search works web built data obscure queries like could turn results combining different datasets across several sites ability query complex data especially help researchers data scientists able potentially combine vast amounts public data private research data discover new interesting things additionally may help training machine learning models specific data sets could crafted may impossible acquire otherwise still barriers overcome changes support semantic web something happen overnight—we talking years small steps incremental improvements even websites rich structured data markup many new tools technologies would need built leverage example berners-lee working solid method allow users greater control data building upon key concepts semantic web like many concepts semantic web critics one cory doctorow goes far call “ pipe-dream founded self-delusion nerd hubris hysterically inflated market opportunities. ” comment without merit several potential problems need considered number websites web vast number types may need represented huge amount data would need understood sufficiently complex query schema.org 841 types scratches surface data could represented looking specific industries data might publicly share could hundreds vocabularies thousands types beyond sheer amount data deciding even classify debates could rage mundane things like whether “ washing machine kitchen appliance household cleaning device. ” semantic web needs handle duplicate data unfortunately might easier trying de-duplicate unstructured data single item might able represented two different vocabularies may different properties defined global identifier data may help specific circumstances however fully solve problem credibility data another key concern semantic web research information currently many different factors may consider determining information read trusted additionally might verify find across multiple different sites systems would need deal factually incorrect data also inconsistency data find maybe biggest problem though technical one human one web developers people interested types technologies might go way add data pages websites would parents want manage data like neighbours friends even tools built average person say would even want use semantic web might dead arrival still long way form semantic web many ways definitely stepping towards

monoliths article ’ discuss reached point brief stroll history networked applications ’ talk temporal ’ stateful execution model attempts solve problems introduced service-oriented architectures soa full disclosure ’ head product temporal might biased think approach future short history lesson twenty years ago developers almost always built monolithic applications model simple consistent similar experience get programming local environment monoliths nature rely single database means state centralized monolith mutate state within single transaction means yields binary outcome—it worked ’ zero room inconsistency therefore monoliths provided great experience developers meant chance failed transactions resulting inconsistent state turn meant developers ’ constantly write code guess state things long time monoliths made good sense ’ ton connected users meant scale requirements software minimal even biggest software giants operating scale seems minuscule today handful companies like amazon google running “ scale ” rare exception rule people like software last 20 years demand software ’ stop growing today applications expected serve global market day one companies like twitter facebook made 24/7 always-online table stakes software ’ powering things behind scenes anymore ’ become end-user experience every company expected software products reliability availability longer features requirements unfortunately monoliths start fall apart scale availability become requirements developers businesses needed find ways keep rapid global growth demanding user expectations began looking alternative architectures would alleviate scalability issues experiencing answer found microservices well service-oriented architectures microservices seemed great initially enabled applications broken relatively self-contained units could scaled independently microservice maintained state meant application longer limited fit single machine developers could finally build applications met scale demands increasingly connected world microservices also brought flexibility teams companies provided clear lines responsibility separation organizational architectures thing free lunch microservices solved scalability availability issues fundamentally blocking software growth well developers began realize microservices came serious drawbacks monoliths generally one database instance one application server since monolith broken two practical options scaling first option vertical scaling means upgrading hardware increase throughput/capacity vertical scaling efficient ’ costly definitely permanent solution application needs keep growing vertically scale enough eventually run hardware upgrade second option horizontal scaling case monolith means creating copies serves specific set users/requests etc horizontally scaling monoliths results resource underutilization high enough scales plain ’ work case microservices whose value comes ability multiple “

microservices ’ addressed developers operators left solve solving infrastructure management issues come microservices tough left applications unreliable best demand ultimate vehicle change microservices adoption increased rapidly developers became increasingly motivated solve underlying infrastructure problems slowly surely solutions started appear technologies like docker kubernetes

distributed ’ j2ee 2.0 situation fact distributed nature backend exactly enables nearly infinite horizontal scaling temporal aims provide consistency simplicity reliability application layer like docker kubernetes serverless infrastructure temporal provides number highly-reliable mechanisms orchestrating microservices important state preservation state preservation temporal feature uses event

even includes local variables threads application-specific state best way understand feature works analogy developer today ’ likely relying version control svn ’ og git track changes make code thing svn ’ snapshotting comprehensive state application change make svn works storing new files references existing files avoiding need duplicate temporal sort rough analogy like svn stateful history running applications whenever code modifies application state temporal automatically stores change result fault-tolerant way means temporal restore crashed applications also roll back fork much result developers longer need build applications assumption underlying server fail developer feature like going manually saving ctrl-s documents every letter type autosave cloud google docs ’ ’ manually saving anymore ’ longer single machine associated document state preservation means developers write far less tedious boilerplate code initially introduced microservices also means ad-hoc infrastructure — like standalone queues caches databases — longer needed reduces ops burden overhead adding new features also makes onboarding new hires much easier longer need ramp messy domain-specific state management code state preservation also comes another form “ durable timers. ” durable timers fault-tolerant mechanism developers leverage workflow.sleep command general workflow.sleep functions exactly like language native sleep command workflow.sleep safely sleep period time matter long many temporal users workflows sleep weeks even years achieve temporal service persists durable timers underlying datastore tracks corresponding code needs resumed even underlying server crashes shut code resumed available machine timer intended fire sleeping workflows consume
