Starting with the new year we'd like to try and cut down on such repetitive discussion. We are going to start with anything Facebook, Inc owned. Facebook is without a doubt one of the top offenders for erosion of our privacy and frankly the best way to escape (most of) their clutches, is to either never have use their products, or if you have been, ditch them. From today, we will not be allowing any posts regarding Facebook, Inc. and its products. edit: The vast majority here knows that Facebook is evil, the point is to stop the verging on circle jerk posts \\/ discussion about how bad facebook is and or the multiple reposts of the latest \\\"shock fb is evil\\\" news to come out. Those who do not, are recommended to read the below subs for more details. If you need help closing your accounts or attempting to manage your accounts privacy settings we suggest going to the relevant subreddit: \\/r\\/facebook \\/r\\/whatsapp \\/r\\/instagram \\/r\\/oculus\\/ If you want to tell the world how evil Facebook, Inc. is, we suggest: \\/r\\/AntiFacebook We'll review the situation in a few weeks and see if we should continue with this stance or address it in a different way.

Crucially, with the pass-otp module, it can also do Two Factor Authentication (2FA\\/TFA) AKA One Time Passwords (OTP) where you use a 6-digit-password that changes every half a minute or so. Usually, normies use a cell phone for this, but you can actually just have pass do it on your computer. I actually have a dmenu prompt that gives me a list of all my OTPs to insert, and it automatically generates the six-digit password. Pass will be in your distro's package repository, but here's the site. https:\\/\\/www.passwordstore.org\\/ pass-otp is probably also in your repository, but here is the Github: https:\\/\\/github.com\\/tadfisher\\/pass-otp Note that I also use the program zbarimg to convert a QR code into text that we can feed into pass-otp. It will be in your distro's package repo too. Pass uses GPG to encrypt and decrypt your passwords, so I also talk about making a GPG key pair.

This means that all communication is handled via central servers of the tech giants. Especially privacy-sensitive users may be put off by this, which I can understand. However, at least from an IT security perspective, I think the use of the rented servers is negligible, since Signal works with the zero-knowledge principle. Certainly, it would be desirable if the Signal Foundation hosted the servers itself. However, this would not necessarily mean a security gain.

Brief background: I've been using windows, android and popular social media my entire life, as I'm kinda born with them and only recently I started being more aware on how free services like Google and others are collecting tons of data on me that I'd just like to stop. I've read different topics, watched videos and browser subs or sites like privacytools or prism-break in order to have some guidance through this journey, it will be without any doubt a long one but hey, better late than never. I've wiped my laptop; I recently bought an upgrade for SSD and after using windows for a few weeks, I decided to try Linux. I already had some experience with Linux in the past, with Ubuntu being my only distro, and this time opted for Pop_OS in order to have a decent compatibility for my hardware. My plan I setting up everything in Linux for the next few weeks\\/month, learning how to use it properly and how to implement some basic privacy measures, while in the meantime keeping my stock Pixel 3a to manage remnants of my previous data and deleting as much stuff as possible. I'd just like to have some general advices on what to do, considering my goal is slowing getting rid of telemetry and tracking stuff at a basic level; I do not need super deep privacy settings that could break my user experience, also because I'm not too much at risk with my data, I'm no journalist or anything particular, just a regular guy using tech for anything, from study related notes and stuff to shopping, reading feeds, entertainment and messaging. I was about to setup properly my Firefox and looking at guides online on privacytools some option like about:config seems quite advanced, or just I don't properly know what I'm doing, so I'd like to receive advice on what the basic procedure (basic add-ons, settings, containers, configs) could look like on a general level, given my kind of usage of the internet. Also while writing I'm looking at all alternative services prism and pt.io lists, switching to foss and privacy oriented services like bitwarden, protonmail (also I read of the nice implementation of free VPN you can achieve with Linux, should this be worth it?), Thunderbird and so on. Was thinking to replace my gdrive\\/OneDrive with mega since seems more safe, while in the meantime learning how to setup a nextcloud mini-server at home. After having a better idea on what to do and having them implemented on my pc I'll make the switch in my mobile too, and I was thinking about grapheneos or microG for LineageOS, but I'll do this after being stable on my desktop with alternatives to ms\\/G running up at their best. So in order to resume this message, I'm seeking some more resources on how to do all of this but in a more \\\"general user\\/dummy\\\" perspective. Any kind of link, feedback and personal experience here is appreciated, thanks in advance for your time :) [link] [comments]\",\"5536\":\"How do I know Google Ads doesn't insert trackers into all of the websites that uses it?

My primary threats are ad-based services, but I use AdGuard. I don't see ads on websites or apps. So, why bother with the inconveniences of more privacy-friendly products and services? While I believe everybody's got something to hide, and there are things I'd rather Google, Microsoft and company not know, I live a mundane life under a decent government. I do want to encourage privacy-friendly products and services to help those who cannot afford to use privacy-invading ones, such as activists and journalists, but not so much at the price of inconvenience. So, does using an ad blocker negate the need for privacy when your primary threats are ad-based services?

I got a text message saying my package was attempted to be delivered but that it had import fees and no one was there to pay them so I have to reschedule. I order quite a few things and don't always keep track so this seemed somewhat reasonable to me and I didn't just dismiss this text as spam. I should have definitely used more common sense though but I didn't and ended up clicking the link which lead to a website which looked very legit but had a sketchy URL. I went through a couple pages (do you want to schedule a pick up, when do you want to schedule it, etc.) until it got to the page where I had to pay the import fee online. At this point, I entered no information and started searching around and also, kind of late, but actually looked up the tracking number (found nothing). I then found out that this is a common scam so I closed the tabs (having entered no information). This all happened on an iPhone 11 (2FA is on and I use BitWarden). Now, my questions are whether or not it's possible that any information of mine was compromised. If so, what are the next steps I can take to make sure that I get myself out of this situation. tl;dr -- on my iphone 11, I clicked a phishing link, went through a couple pages of the site but entered no information, have 2FA on and use bitwarden - am I screwed?

But now I have a question. We all know that google spies on you and shit, and I've encountered a problem: I can't just delete my google account. I would lose my email, and thus, not having access to all of my accounts (reddit, twitter, steam etc...) I think I can easily change emails (I know that you can do it on reddit and twitter for sure), but there's still maybe some random account out there that I need my gmail email to access it. And also another big problem is Google Drive and Google Photos. I have a huge backup of files Google Drive (but I'm most probably upgrade to an ssd to my pc and use my hdd as a backup), and all my photos on Google Photos, so that my phone can have 0 photos, but still see them with the app. Is there any way to still get some sort of could photos app? And also, maybe something that doesn't cost? (Unfortunately I still don't have a credit card to pay or just money in general since my parents are strict), and also, I would specifiy that my Google Photos have around 1.5 gb of photos which isnt much, so just 5 gb or even 3 gb would be fine.

I plan to keep my gmail account since I will need it for other purposes. There are two ways I can think of managing my email accounts: Completely delink all my services from Google and gmail and essentially make my gmail inbox a ghost town. Use my gmail inbox as a deadspace to send all the trash emails that I wouldn't want cluttering my primary account. Stuff like newsletters, one-time registrations, etc. I got the idea from my Dad who does the same thing with his old hotmail account. Of course both the methods listed above might be discouraged and I might be looking at it the wrong way. In that case, I would like to know what your recommendations are in email management. Do you have separate email accounts for social media? Those of you who still keep their gmail accounts, what do you do with them? Also what's your opinion on registering for accounts with other accounts? Stuff like 'Sign in with Google' or 'Sign in with Github'? I use Github now, but I have a feeling this practice might be frowned upon. Is it better to just sign up to services manually through email accounts?

There are 2 paths one can go, first one being using decentralized exchanges that say they do not require KYC, but like 80% of them will ask for it sooner or later. Only really few smaller\\/unknown ones will not. And with those 20% you can only do smaller amounts, as they either have no volume and being the unknown the risk is high. Second way is to use well known exchanges, have no limits and have access to serious volume so you can always do the trade + added benefits of different trading options. Also reputable exchanges have way more trading pairs, compared to those smaller non-KYC that have just the main few. It's clear that non-KYC route lacks in almost every aspect compared to KYC one, but when I see the KYC requirements and read on what they ask in the process it's kinda hard to go in that direction. I'm interested to hear the opinions of the folks from this sub - what could be the middle ground between those two, if there is one?

Alright. I decided to post it to r\\/privacy then. That's where I originally found out about PM - other privacy enthusiasts might value this information - maybe they'll be as surprised as me - or maybe no one cares. Plus it's a more neutral space, not associated with PM. But, that post was also was removed by mods. One of the mods was nice and wanted me to wait until the situation concluded. Finally, this morning, PM reinstated my account, and told me to read their terms and conditions. Ok but what criminal activity was I involved in? Eventually they wrote back, explaining that it was disabled \\\"as part of an investigation into the OGU*ers forum.\\\" (I censored it because it is an illegal site (?) ) I didn't remember ever being a part of OGU*srs, and a search in my inbox revealed no emails from the forum. So I visit the OGU*ers site, and an old acct popped up on my old password app. So I guess I did join up at some point, years ago. However - I had zero activity on the site. I may have once joined it, but that's about the extent my involvement. That may be against Swiss law, and I might actually be a criminal, but PM said they can't comment any further on the matter. So, please be aware that using a PM address with a forum of that nature, despite not having any activity nor email activity from them, is a misuse\\/abuse of email, and PM may disable your account without notice, to prevent further misuse. I'll leave it at that. At least I found out why. I'm still surprised at what happened. Maybe I'm alone in thinking that, IDK. Hopefully this post won't be removed, as the situation is now complete. And fingers crossed I'm not arrested for self-snitching with this post. And though I might not use PM anymore after this, TY PM for giving me a second chance.

So, if someone will access your master password and use it to login via IMAP, then he\\/she will be able to remove 2FA easily, access our account and change account recovery options, password, etc. We will just loose our account. 2FA is useless in that case. \\u200b What do you think about it?

TL;DR: I work as a data analyst for a healthcare company and am very good at a handful of programming languages (SQL, R, a little bit of Python). That being said, I am very raw in understanding the many facets of countersurveillance. I want to work full-time for a company\\/project\\/non-profit whose goal it is to destroy mass surveillance. What advice can you give me? Long version: I am in my mid 20s and graduated college a couple years ago with a degree in data analytics. I work for a healthcare company as a data analyst and have been there a couple of years. I am proficient in SQL, R, Tableau, etc. and have been learning Python over the past 6 months. I first started using programming languages about 5 years ago and I really enjoy coding as both a hobby and a profession. That being said, over the past two years or so, I have become increasingly aware of what is happening in the world around us and I made meaningful changes in my life to try to stop mass surveillance, even if only on a personal level. I don't have any social media accounts outside of Reddit, I threw away my Fitbit, stopped using credit cards almost entirely (save for paying my rent- landlord won't accept cash), stopped using my gmail account and got a paid ProtonMail email and VPN, and I threw away my iPhone (I now own a flip phone that has the battery removed whenever it's not in use- probably about 22 hours of the day). Of course, I still have a long way to go, as we all do. I really believe that changing your life- whether in regards to mass surveillance or something else- is a gradual and evolving process. I have a Reddit account and I am writing this post so obviously I am not completely off the grid (nor will I ever be). But I think it's pretty clear to see that I have taken mass surveillance very seriously, and not to brag, but I imagine that the changes I have made in my personal life are more significant and effective at curbing mass surveillance than probably 95% of this community's actions in their personal lives. That being said, my knowledge of countersurveillance is still extremely raw and I would like to work on improving it. To this end, I feel that Python is a good language to be well-versed in, which is why I have been investing time over the past several months in learning it. What advice can you give me to achieve my goal of leaving my job and working for a company\\/project\\/non-profit aimed at stopping mass surveillance? I am interested in not only specific company names and\\/or projects but also the tools\\/skills that I can learn to become a better candidate and hopefully a better employee for a company fighting to stop mass surveillance.

I subscribed to the service, but on GrapheneOS I can't use the service without google play, which I definitely dont want on my new, googleless (to my limited understanding anyway) phone. How can I use this service but with my phone? Thank you in advance. Edit: To clarify, I was able to get the APK to install just fine, however the app is useless without the Google Play store. I would like to know if anyone has found a way around that. [link] [comments]\",\"1742\":\"Read the full story\",\"2091\":\"This guide aims to be the most exhaustive resource available for documenting alternatives to Google products. With growing concerns over online privacy and securing personal data, more people than ever are considering alternatives to Google products. After all, Google\\u2019s business model essentially revolves around data collection and advertisements, both of which infringe on your privacy. More data means better (targeted) ads and more revenue. The company pulled in over $116 billion in ad revenue last year alone \\u2013 and that number continues to grow. But the word is getting out. A growing number of people are seeking alternatives to Google products that respect their privacy and data. So let\\u2019s get started. Note: The lists below are not necessarily in rank order. Choose the best products and services based on your own unique needs. Google search alternatives When it comes to privacy, using Google search is not a good idea. When you use their search engine, Google is recording your IP address, search terms, user agent, and often a unique identifier, which is stored in cookies. Here are ten alternatives to Google search: Searx \\u2013 A privacy-friendly and versatile metasearch engine that\\u2019s also open source. MetaGer \\u2013 An open source metasearch engine with good features, based in Germany. SwissCows \\u2013 A zero-tracking private search engine based in Switzerland, hosted on secure Swiss infrastructure. Qwant \\u2013 A private search engine based in France. DuckDuckGo \\u2013 A private search engine based in the US. Mojeek \\u2013 The only true search engine (rather than metasearch engine) that has its own crawler and index (based in the UK). YaCy \\u2013 A decentralized, open source, peer-to-peer search engine. Givero \\u2013 Based in Denmark, Givero offers more privacy than Google and combines search with charitable donations. Ecosia \\u2013 Ecosia is based in Germany and donates a part of revenues to planting trees. *Note: With the exception of Mojeek, all of the private search engines above are technically metasearch engines, since they source their results from other search engines, such as Bing and Google. (Startpage is no longer recommended.) Gmail alternatives Gmail may be convenient and popular, but there are three major problems: Your inbox is used as a data collection tool. (Did you know Google is tracking your purchasing history from the receipts in your inbox?) Rather than seeing just emails, your email inbox is also used for ads and marketing. The contents of your inbox are being shared with Google and other random third parties. When you remain logged in to your Gmail account, Google can easily track your activities online as you browse different websites, which may be hosting Google Analytics or Google ads (Adsense). Here are ten alternatives to Gmail that do well in terms of privacy: Tutanota \\u2013 based in Germany; very secure and private; free accounts up to 1 GB Mailfence \\u2013 based in Belgium; lots of features; free accounts up to 500 MB Posteo \\u2013 based in Germany; \\u20ac1\\/mo with 14 day refund window StartMail \\u2013 based in Netherlands; $5.00\\/mo with 7 day free trial Runbox \\u2013 based in Norway; lots of storage and features; $1.66\\/mo with 30 day free trial Mailbox.org \\u2013 based in Germany; \\u20ac1\\/mo with 30 day free trial CounterMail \\u2013 based in Sweden; $4.00\\/mo with 7 day free trial Kolab Now \\u2013 based in Switzerland; \\u20ac4.41\\/mo with 30 day money-back guarantee ProtonMail \\u2013 based in Switzerland; free accounts up to 500 MB Thexyz \\u2013 based in Canada; $1.95\\/mo with 30 day refund window Chrome alternatives Google Chrome is a popular browser, but it\\u2019s also a data collection tool \\u2013 and many people are taking notice. Just a few days ago, the Washington Post asserted that \\u201cGoogle\\u2019s web browser has become spy software,\\u201d with 11,000 tracker cookies observed in a single week. Here are seven alternatives for more privacy: Firefox browser \\u2013 Firefox is a very customizable, open-source browser that is popular in privacy circles. There are also many different Firefox modifications and tweaks that will give you more privacy and security. (Also check out Firefox Focus, a privacy-focused version for mobile users.) Iridium \\u2013 Based on open source Chromium, Iridium offers numerous privacy and security enhancements over Chrome, source code here. GNU IceCat \\u2013 A fork of Firefox from the Free Software Foundation. Tor browser \\u2013 A hardened and secured version of Firefox that runs on the Tor network by default. (It also does a good job against browser fingerprinting.) Ungoogled Chromium \\u2013 Just as the name says, this is an open source version of Chromium that has been \\u201cungoogled\\u201d and modified for more privacy. Brave \\u2013 Brave is another Chromium-based browser that is rather popular. It blocks trackers and ads by default (except for \\u201capproved\\u201d ads that are part of the \\u201cBrave Ads\\u201d network). Waterfox \\u2013 This is a fork of Firefox that is configured for more privacy by default, with Mozilla telemetry stripped out of the code. Of course, there are other alternatives to Chrome, such as Safari (from Apple), Microsoft Internet Explorer\\/Edge, Opera, and Vivaldi \\u2013 but these also come with some privacy drawbacks. Google Drive alternatives If you\\u2019re looking for a secure cloud storage option, you can check out these Google Drive alternatives: Tresorit \\u2013 A user-friendly cloud storage option based in Switzerland. ownCloud \\u2013 An open source and self-hosted cloud platform developed in Germany. Nextcloud \\u2013 Nextcloud is also an open source, self-hosted file sharing and collaboration platform, based in Germany. Sync \\u2013 Based in Canada, Sync offers a secure, encrypted cloud storage solution for businesses and individuals. Syncthing \\u2013 Here we have a decentralized, open source, peer-to-peer cloud storage platform. Of course, Dropbox is another popular Google drive alternative, but it\\u2019s not the best in terms of privacy. Google Calendar alternative Here are some Google Calendar alternatives: Lightning Calendar is an open source calendar option developed by Mozilla, and it\\u2019s compatible with Thunderbird and Seamonkey. Etar, an open source, basic calendar option. Fruux, an open source calendar with good features and support for many operating systems. For those wanting a combined solution for both email and calendar functionality, these providers offer that: Mailfence Kolab Now Posteo.de Mailbox.org Tutanota Google Docs \\/ Sheets \\/ Slides alternative There are many solid Google Docs alternatives available. The largest offline document editing suite is, of course, Microsoft Office. As most people know, however, Microsoft is not the best company for privacy. Nonetheless, there are a few other good Google Docs alternatives: CryptPad \\u2013 CryptPad is a privacy-focused alternative with strong encryption, and it\\u2019s free. Etherpad \\u2013 A self-hosted collaborative online editor that\\u2019s also open source. Mailfence Documents \\u2013 From the Mailfence team, this is a secure file sharing, storage, and collaboration tool. Zoho Docs \\u2013 This is another good Google Docs alternative with a clean interface and good functionality, although it may not be the best for privacy. OnlyOffice \\u2013 OnlyOffice feels a bit more restricted than some of the other options in terms of features. Cryptee \\u2013 This is a privacy-focused platform for photo and document storage and editing. It\\u2019s open source and based in Estonia. LibreOffice (offline) \\u2013 You can use LibreOffice which is free and open source. Apache OpenOffice (offline) \\u2013 Another good open source office suite. Google Photos alternative Here are a few good Google Photos alternatives: Piwigo \\u2013 Piwigo is a great option that you can self-host. It is also free and open source. Lychee \\u2013 Lychee is another self-hosted, open source photo management platform. Cryptee \\u2013 Mentioned already above, Cyrptee is also a great option for securely storing photos. Shoebox was another alternative, but it closed operations in June 2019. YouTube alternatives Unfortunately, YouTube alternatives can really be hit or miss, with most struggling to gain popularity. Peertube DTube Bitchute invidio.us Vimeo Bit.tube Dailymotion Hooktube Tip: Invidio.us is a great Youtube proxy that allows you to watch any Youtube video without logging in, even if the video is somehow restricted. To do this, simply replace [www.youtube.com] with [invidio.us] in the URL you want to view. Google translate alternative Here are a few Google translate alternatives I have come across: DeepL \\u2013 DeepL is a solid Google Translate alternative that seems to give great results. Like Google Translate, DeepL allows you to post up to 5,000 characters at a time (but the pro version is unlimited). The user interface is good and there is also a built-in dictionary feature. Linguee \\u2013 Linguee does not allow you to post large blocks of text like DeepL. However, Linguee will give you very accurate translations for single words or phrases, along with context examples. dict.cc \\u2013 This Google Translate alternative seems to do a decent job on single-world lookups, but it also feels a bit outdated. Swisscows Translate \\u2013 A good translation service supporting many languages. If you want to translate blocks of text, check out DeepL. If you want in-depth translations for single words or phrases, then Linguee is a good choice. Google analytics alternative For website admins, there are many reasons to use an alternative to Google analytics. Aside from privacy concerns, there are also faster and more user-friendly alternatives that also respect your visitors\\u2019 privacy. Clicky is a great alternative to Google Analytics that truncates and anonymizes visitor IP addresses by default. It is lightweight, user-friendly, and fully compliant with GDPR regulations, while also being certified by Privacy Shield. Matomo (formerly Piwik) is an open-source analytics platform that respects the privacy of visitors by anonymizing and truncating visitor IP addresses (if enabled by the website admin). It is also certified to respect user privacy. Fathom Analytics is an open source alternative to Google Analytics that\\u2019s available on Github here. It\\u2019s minimal, fast, and lightweight. Get Insights \\u2013 Another privacy-focused analytics platform, with a full analytics suite. The front-end client is open source and available here. AT Internet is a France-based analytics provider that is fully GDPR compliant, with all data stored on French servers, and a good track record going back to 1996. Many websites host Google Analytics because they run Google Adsense campaigns. Without Google Analytics, tracking performance of these campaigns would be difficult. Nonetheless, there are still better options for privacy. Google Maps alternative A map alternative for PCs is OpenStreetMap. A few Google Maps alternatives for mobile devices include: OsmAnd is a free and open-source mobile maps app for both Android and iOS (based on OpenStreetMap data). Maps (F Droid) uses OpenStreetMap data (offline). Maps.Me is another option that is free on both Android and iOS, but there is a fair amount of data collection with this alternative, as explained in their privacy policy. MapHub is also based on OpenStreeMap data and it does not collect locations or user IP addresses. Note: Waze is not an \\u201calternative\\u201d as it is now owned by Google. Google Play Store alternative Currently the best Google Play Store alternative is to use F-Droid and then go through the Yalp store. As explained on the official site, F-Droid is an installable catalog of FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) applications for the Android platform. After you have installed F-Droid, you can then download the Yalp store APK, which allows you to download apps from the Google Play Store directly as APK files. \\ud83d\\udcf7The Yalp Store is a good alternative to the Google Play Store. See the F-Droid website or the official GitHub page for more info. Other alternatives to the Google Play Store include: Aptoide \\u2013 An independent marketplace for Android apps. APKMirror \\u2013 This is a large library of APK files uploaded by different users (be careful). Aurora Store \\u2013 A fork of the Yalp Store. Google Chrome OS alternative Want to ditch the Chromebook and Chrome OS? Here are a few alternatives: Linux \\u2013 Of course, Linux is arguably the best alternative, being a free, open-source operating system with lots of different flavors. With some adjustments, Linux Ubuntu can be run on Chromebooks. Tails \\u2013 Tails is a free, privacy-focused operating system based on Linux that routes all traffic through the Tor network. QubesOS \\u2013 Recommended by Snowden, free, and also open source. Of course, the other two big operating system alternatives are Windows and Apple\\u2019s operating system for MacBooks \\u2013 Mac OS. Windows, particularly Windows 10, is a very bad option for privacy. While slightly better, Apple also collects user data and has partnered with the NSA) for surveillance. Android alternatives The biggest alternative to Android is iOS from Apple. But we\\u2019ll skip over that for reasons already mentioned. Here are a few Android OS alternatives: LineageOS \\u2013 A free and open-source operating system for phones and tablets based on Android. Ubuntu Touch \\u2013 A mobile version of the Ubuntu operating system. Plasma Mobile \\u2013 An open source, Linux-based operating system with active development. Sailfish OS \\u2013 Another open source, Linux-based mobile OS. Replicant \\u2013 A fully free Android distribution with an emphasis on freedom, privacy, and security. \\/e\\/ \\u2013 This is another open source project with a focus on privacy and security. Purism is also working on a privacy-focused mobile phone called the Librem 5. It is in production, but not yet available (estimated Q3 2019). Google Hangouts alternatives Here are some alternatives to Google Hangouts: Wire \\u2013 A great all-around secure messenger, video, and chat app, but somewhat limited on the number of people who can chat together in a group conversation via voice or video. Signal \\u2013 A good secure messenger platform from Open Whisper Systems. Telegram \\u2013 A longtime secure messenger app, formerly based in Russia, now in Dubai. Riot \\u2013 A privacy-focused encrypted chat service that is also open source. Google Domains alternative Google Domains is a domain registration service. Here are a few alternatives: Namecheap \\u2013 I like Namecheap because all domain purchases now come with free WhoisGuard protection for life, which protects your contact information from third parties. Namecheap also accepts Bitcoin and offers domain registration, hosting, email, SSL certs, and a variety of other products. Njalla \\u2013 Njalla is a privacy-focused domain registration service based in Nevis. They offer hosting options, too, and also accept cryptocurrency payments. OrangeWebsite \\u2013 OrangeWebsite offers anonymous domain registration services and also accepts cryptocurrency payments, based in Iceland. Other Google alternatives Here more alternatives for various Google products: Google forms alternative \\u2013 JotForm is a free online form builder. Google Keep alternative \\u2013 Below are a few different Google Keep alternatives: Standard Notes is a great alternative for a note-taking service. It is secure, encrypted, and free with apps for Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android (web-based also available). Joplin is another great option that is open source and works on Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android. Zoho Notebook from Zoho, with apps for desktop and mobile devices. QOwnNotes is an open source file editor with Nextcloud integration. Google Fonts alternative \\u2013 Many websites load Google fonts through Google APIs, but that\\u2019s not necessary. One alternative to this is to use Font Squirrel, which has a large selection of both Google and non-Google fonts which are free to download and use. Google Voice alternative \\u2013 JMP.chat (both free and paid) G Suite alternative \\u2013 Zoho is probably the best option Google Firebase alternative \\u2013 Kuzzle (free and open source) Google Blogger alternatives \\u2013 WordPress, Medium, and Ghost are all good options.

The Lecture What are the health effects of mobile phones and wireless radiation? While Australia has led the world in safety standards, including compulsory seat-belt legislation, plain packaging on cigarettes, and product and food disclosure legislation, it falls behind in addressing the significant issues associated with mobile phone use. In this Dean\\u2019s Lecture, epidemiologist and electromagnetic radiation expert, Dr Devra Davis, will outline the evolution of the mobile phone and smartphone, and provide a background to the current 19 year old radiation safety standards (SAR), policy developments and international legislation. New global studies on the health consequences of mobile\\/wireless radiation will be presented, including children\\u2019s exposure and risks. The Speaker Dr Devra Davis is an internationally recognised expert on electromagnetic radiation from mobile phones and other wireless transmitting devices. She is currently the Visiting Professor of Medicine at the Hebrew University Hadassah Medical School, and Visiting Professor of Medicine at Ondokuz Mayis University, Turkey.

In 2007, Dr Devra Davis founded non\\u00adprofit Environmental Health Trust to provide basic research and education about environmental health hazards. Dr Davis served as the President Clinton appointee to the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board in the U.S.A. from 1994\\u2013\\u00ad1999, an independent executive branch agency that investigates, prevents and mitigates chemical accidents. As the former Senior Advisor to the Assistant Secretary for Health in the Department of Health and Human Services, she has counseled leading officials in the United States, United Nations, European Environment Agency, Pan American Health Organization, World Health Organization, and World Bank. Dr Davis holds a B.S. in physiological psychology and an M.A. in sociology from the University of Pittsburgh, 1967. She completed a PhD in science studies at the University of Chicago as a Danforth Foundation Graduate Fellow, 1972 and a M.P.H. in epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins University as a Senior National Cancer Institute Post-\\u00adDoctoral Fellow, 1982. She has authored more than 200 publications and has been published in Lancet and Journal of the American Medical Association as well as the Scientific American and the New York Times.

To put it in other words... The common way of looking at Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is that it's a metric of economic success: more GDP is more wealth. Wealth is good. \\\"Poverty\\\" (meaning low per capita GDP) is bad. Nowadays, pretty much everyone talks about \\\"economics\\\" like this as if this truism was scribbled on the back walls of the cosmos. This is just looking at one side of the ledger in a kind of global double-entry accounting book. A logically equivalent way of looking at it is that GDP is a metric of economic exchange required for survival in society as it exists. You can say that some area \\\"produced\\\" $1 billion of output (sounds good), but you can just as easily say that $1 billion was required for that area to sustain itself (sounds bad). These two are simply logically equivalent. Living on $1 a day Antediluvian Hyperborea. GDP: $0 per year. Let's dive into the Gestalt: when you hear that a family of eight lives on less than a dollar per day (PPP adjusted), you might wonder how they manage! To actually do such a thing would require buying large bags of rice for the whole family, eat only that and live in free cardboard boxes. The reality is that that often uttered phrase means that they use less than $1 a day in the general economy, while the rest of their livelihood is \\\"off-the-grid\\\" or self-sufficient. They may grow food in a family farm, hunt for food, and most of their daily needs from cooking oils, to plates, to pottery, to soap are often made at home as well. There is still \\\"an economy\\\" but often one that is barter based or socialist in the real pre-socialist sense of the word: mediated by direct face-to-face social tit-for-tat between neighbors and friends, none of this mediated by currency being exchanged, thus it is not part of the GDP. If you read about some Bangladeshi village where the only product is \\\"textiles\\\", that doesn't mean that everyone there makes textiles all day and, without a textile company, everyone would've starved to death. It means that the only on-paper, measurable global industry practiced there is textile manufacturing. Other villagers might farm, hunt, even do some kind of gathering in some places. They will produce the arts and crafts and live the way people live when you leave them alone. If your view of the world is mediated by GDP, you're only seeing the extremely small sliver that pops into existence when people exchange something involving legal tender. This is extremely difficult for us modern bugpeople to understand because to be a bugman in a large city is to produce absolutely nothing on one's own and buy literally everything you need from the store. To us non-productive people, GDP means income which means survival. But the further out of Bugmanville you go, the clearer the vacuousness of GDP becomes. When you realize that most of human wealth is unmeasured by GDP, you realize that Whig History and Steven Pinkerism is based on shaky foundations. Example A minor example. We had a large Thanksgiving feast near my uncle's house in very rural Florida. As it got cold in the night, we had a fire in a repurposed old sugar cane cooking vat artfully standing on used symmetrical cinderblock pieces. A bugman hipster might pay two hundred dollars or more for a similar looking \\\"authentic\\\" piece of equipment. Those $200 would be counted in the GDP. A bugman hipster might have also bought or rented chairs for the event, \\\"contributing\\\" more to the GDP, but my uncle, as part of the local wholesome church community, simply borrowed some from the church. Thus our event produced basically no GDP output in goods or services, despite being functionally equivalent to some similar but expensive and ergo \\\"productive\\\" \\\"Friendsgiving\\\" practiced by urbanites. In reality we are richer than the bugmen hipsters who blew hundreds of dollars on a faux-folksy party. In this case, we owned the firepit and had easy access and permission to the chairs, thus we are more economically flexible than they are. That GDP that they produced\\/expended is evidence of deeper reliance on the economic system. That GDP output is a marker of fragility, reliance on the conditions of the outside economy in the same way that a village of Bangladeshis who abandon their traditional way of lives to work on textiles are more fragile, despite being able to save up for iPhones. What GDP really measures Most of the increase in GDP across the world is simply the movement from local partially-social partially-under-the-table economies to economies mediated by taxable currency. An economically self-sufficient village with close social relationships and a barter economy has 0 GDP. A township of entrepreneurs and artisans you partially barter and partially use currency which they don't report has 0 GDP. All of these people are \\\"in poverty\\\" and \\\"earn less than a dollar a day\\\". And if you want to be truly self-sufficient, that means having a personal GDP of zero. More than that, pretty much everywhere, GDP is a strong indicator of social upheaval. If you think that GDP is some eternal goodness, remember that everything \\\"good\\\" about industrialization shows up in the GDP, while at the same time, everything bad about it will not show up. Or, sometimes bad things are registered as positive economic growth: urbanization has caused mass-disease, and if that means a market for new medical services and pharmaceuticals, great! The GDP just went up! The Ganges is polluted due to the textile plant? That just means more opportunities for local entrepreneurs to sell bottled water! The GDP just went up! Are people being pushed out of fishing or other subsistence occupations because of it? Even better! Now they have no choice but to contribute to the GDP! With every passing year, in fact, more and more of the GDP is produced by dealing with the problems that our higher level of GDP have caused. At the end of the day, GDP is only a measurement of how reliant a place or country is on the global economy. Self-sufficiency has a GDP of 0. Wasteful consooomerism has an extremely large GDP. Planned obsolescence I have one of my great grandfather's early electric circular saws. It has a bunch of gunk in it, but it still works (although I recently took it apart to replace some old screws and springs and other little parts to be careful). They literally do not make circular saws like it; it's all metal, while even the fancy modern stuff is mostly plastic. The \\\"unfortunate\\\" thing about it and other durable tools is that it's \\\"bad for the economy,\\\" especially the GDP. Since that thing has been around since maybe the 50's or 60's, that's as long as 70 years the economy has gone without the \\\"stimulation\\\" of us having to buy another saw. Viewers of my technology videos: Which would be better for the world, if everyone used the material equivalent of a classic American-made IBM ThinkPad, or some Apple Laptops that are unfixable computers made of mostly batteries designed to conk out right before the new version comes out? Regardless, the Apple Macs that cost thousands a piece are much better for the \\\"economy.\\\" That's what I mean. If you have quality tools and do not need to constantly throw money at the system to buy things, fix things and otherwise waste money, you are going to be having a lower GDP. That's just how it is. The propagandistic role of GDP When you don't think things through like this, GDP is supposed to appear as an objective measure of economic goodness. You're supposed to be looking at those GDP charts and saying, \\\"Wow, my life might be terrible, I am not free, I am subject to forces out of my control, and I and told I have to participate in mass-consumerism to survive, but these charts are the facts[!], and the facts say that things are better now, so I believe them!\\\" It's legitimately surprising to me how big of a boon the idea of increasing GDP is for Whig history and NPCs of many different ideologies. People of the Left and Right will matter-of-factly tell me that a plastic based economy taking over the world is still good because the line is going up. I've heard it as a justification for everything: Don't like globalization? You're wrong, the GDP is going up. Don't trust state-funded institutionalized science? You're wrong, the GDP is going up. Don't want child drag queens? You're wrong, the GDP is going up. Don't want everything to be made of plastics and other petrochemicals? You're wrong, the GDP is going up. Don't want mass pornography? You're wrong, the GDP is going up. Don't want free sugary drinks since infancy? You're wrong, the GDP is going up. When you abandon the illusion of GDP, you are suddenly able to ask whether massive technological \\\"progress\\\" has actually been good for real human life and human pychology.\",\"413\":\"I've added a new personal \\\"Academic\\\" page on my website, including some as-of-yet unreleased Luke Smith cahntent to consooom.

I'm debating on my custom domain over the next couple of days. The plan was @surname.com\\/me\\/whatever. It seems that's only really recommended for professional emails and such, and instead have a completely different custom domain (in case of moving mail providers at some point in the future) and use email aliases for basically every account I have? So I'd need two custom domains, 1 for professional, 1 for everything else. The everything else domain I'd use aliases on? Only problem with that is proton mail charges a good amount for two custom domains. Is it recommended\\/suggested to just have 1 custom domain that isn't a surname (or something recognizable) and use all aliases except for professional emails in which I'd just give out name@surname? The downside I see to that is that leaves the domain theoretically traceable from professional to non-professional accounts? This is where I'm stuck, so I'm back to 2 custom domains and paying Protonmail a bunch of money to make this work. Am I missing something? [link] [comments]\",\"2102\":\"Welcome to \\/r\\/DeGoogle!

Such as your email addresses, phone numbers, addresses, family & relatives, and much more. How far is far enough? Majority of these large corporations do not care about users' privacy. Since they don't, there is only one person that can make the change. You are your own data controller. How to get Started First determine your threat model, or how far you want to dive. It's okay to change this goal at a later time if you feel you want to go further into repalcements or go lighter if you realize there's that one tool that can't yet be replaced. Everyone will have their own pace, objectives and goals in mind. So while we see some extremists here zero google products, we will see the opposite side of the spectrum with users needing to keep a few google applications. Please be nice to users on all levels and a reminder to all degooglers, that degoogling even a little bit is better than nothing. After determine how far you want to take this you can look into the next application that applies to you; Search Engines One of the best ways to starting freeing yourself is to choose a more user respecting search engine. A few options out there include https:\\/\\/duckduckgo.com, https:\\/\\/www.startpage.com\\/, https:\\/\\/www.qwant.com\\/, https:\\/\\/metager.de\\/en, and https:\\/\\/searx.me\\/. Please visit our wiki for further details. By using an alternative search engine, you're already loosing the grip google has on you as a user and disallowing google to gain that much more data on you. Browsers Another fantastic step is to change browsers if your using chrome as it is run and owned by google. If you don't want to step too far away from chrome, you may want to look into ungoogled chromium, icecat, or (brave*)[https:\\/\\/brave.com\\/]. Side note for brave: While they have good built in ad blocking, tracker protection, and give users a chrome like feel, they have been discovered to some minor shady activity. Source 1, Source 2. Since discovery, it is said they have fixed this practice and no longer add affiliate links. However they are not to be fully trusted and should be watched closely, the main reason we mention brave is because some folks still consider a good stepping stone as out of the box it has better tracking protections than firefox. The best browser you can switch to is firefox. To get it privacy oriented, it will involve some add-on installations and about:config page changes. A few basic add-ons that are good to start with are; firefox multi-account containers, invidious redirect, terms of service; didn't read, and ublock origin. Some more advanced add-ons like noscript or umatrix really give good insight of how much google and facebook tracking scripts are really out there on the web. We recommend checking https:\\/\\/privacytools.io or \\/r\\/privacytoolsio for the latest firefox recommendations. The reason firefox is the most recommended as it is the most configurable and customizable browser option at this point. Lately we have seen tor recommended more than usual. Please only use tor if you're browsing .onion webpages or if you have a need for the tor network on clearnet. Using tor for everything, ie when it's not essential slows down the tor network for all users. So please don't recommend tor in place of using a VPN and be kind to others, use the proper service for the proper job. Browser Addons Above we went over a few different browser add-ons, this section gives a brief summary of what they do and how they may help us. Firefox Multi-Account Containers lets you keep parts of your online life separated into color-coded tabs that preserve your privacy. Cookies are separated by container, allowing you to use the web with multiple identities or accounts simultaneously. Invidous redirect - redirects all YouTube links to Invidous. Previously hooktube-redirect, but changed since hooktube is no longer allowed to use the YouTube API, apparently. Invidious is an alternative front-end to YouTube without ads and doesn't require a Google account to save subscriptions Terms of Service; Didn't Read - This extension informs you instantly of your rights online by showing an unintrusive icon in the toolbar. You can click on this icon to get summaries from the Terms of Service; Didn't Read initiative. Ublock origin - an efficient wide-spectrum content blocker. Easy on CPU and memory. Noscript (advanced) - The best security you can get in a web browser! Allow potentially malicious web content to run only from sites you trust. Protect yourself against XSS other web security exploits. Umatrix (advanced) - Point & click to forbid\\/allow any class of requests made by your browser. Use it to block scripts, iframes, ads, facebook, google, etc. Email This may be big for some people, to switch away from gmail\\/microsoft mail. This is one of the most crucial steps if your in it for the long haul. Services like gmail scan all users emails for tracking, receipts, ad personalization, who you talk to, when you talk to people, attachments, message details, and much more. In combination of email, search, voice to text and tracking scripts across the web companies like google can build a complete file on each individual user. Their likes, dislikes, secrets, hobbies, political stance, preferences, locations, driving habits, moods and much more. It's quite scary to realize how much data they actually store and why they would ever need some of that data. Two of the most recommended email providers in the privacy community are protonmail \\/r\\/protonmail and tutanota \\/r\\/tutanota. They both offer free plans as well as upgraded paid plans with additional features. A few other great alternatives include https:\\/\\/mailbox.org, https:\\/\\/posteo.de\\/, https:\\/\\/disroot.org\\/en\\/services\\/email, https:\\/\\/startmail.com\\/, and https:\\/\\/fastmail.com. You may need to test a few to find which provider works best for your usage. Video Sharing Platform This may be one of the hardest for most folks. Youtube has been around many years, has amassed a huge library of content and in turn has the largest amount of users of any video sharing service. The best alternative would be to switch into a federated video sharing platform such as peertube. If you still need that youtube content, you can easily import the video into most peertube instances with just the url, use newpipe on android or use invidios on desktop. Both newpipe and invidous retrieve content from google video servers without you having to deal with their UI, tracking, or the need of a google account. Wrap up We've talked about a few of the alternatives in browsers, add-ons, email providers, and search engines. But there is much more information out there. You can replace your google maps\\/waze, cloud storage, note taking apps, fitness trackers, domain registrars, hardware, operating system, google forms, recaptcha, google photos and much more. All of those have google run projects which we should try our best to use an alternative when feasible. While this guide can be a great starting point, it is not meant to be the end all be all, things change constantly or your preferences may differ from the recommendations above.

Edit: I am able to get the welcome page on search.mydomain.com, and able to have searx on http:\\/\\/:8888. But I cannot connect them. Second edit: I just noticed I named this post \\\"Sears ...\\\" instead of \\\"Searx ...\\\", sorry.

The issue is I don't have cell reception either... The three things I'm going to get are: 1) A Verizon unlimited and unmetered plan 2) A 4G LTE router that works with the Verizon system and has coaxial cable inputs 3) An antenna system that can connect to the router to get distant connections. The closest cell tower is a little under 10 miles away. The issue is that I'm not sure how to get the *best* deals and best products for each of these purposes so I'm asking for help. I hope to buy what I need by the end of the week or maybe next week at the latest. People have suggested the Mofi router and getting a parabolic grid or directional MIMO\\/Yagi antennas. If anyone has had experience please share them. I'll also need some Verizon plan, so if anyone knows where I can get an old grandfathered plan, feel free to tell me. I'll be putting up videos of getting all of this stuff working.

I have a domain on google domains which I just use for catch-all mail, since I can register to each and every site with site@my-domain.com Now unfortunately, I am too dependent on this and it would be a real pain to change all the emails. What I wanted to know, is it even possible to just transfer the domain to another provider, preferably with catch all mail so I can keep everything tidy. Do you have any recommendations? My end goal is splitting my online life and personal life. I'm using proton for my personal life mail, and the domain with catch all for the \\\"online\\\" life, but I'm guessing most of you have seen the latest scandal with proton so I'm not even sure where to go now regarding a safe email provider.

I'm usingthis Image because it's the only one i've found that is compatible with the architecture. I would however like to customize SearX a bit and want to access the settings.yml file but i don't know where to look for it and nowhere i've searched (inside the data volume) i've had success. Does anybody have a solution for this problem? Thanks in advance Edit: to future people having the same problem: I used docker exec -it [container-name] \\/bin\\/ bash to get inside the container. Then i installed nano editor inside the container ( try apk add if apt-get doesn't work). Now i can edit settings.yml inside the container.
